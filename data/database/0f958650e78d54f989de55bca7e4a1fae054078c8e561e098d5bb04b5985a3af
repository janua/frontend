Gregg McClymont, the shadow pensions minister, said a \"botched\" consultation by Webb would deprive future pensioners of tens of thousands of pounds.</p><p>McClymont spoke out after Webb appeared to suggest in a written ministerial statement that a cap had been abandoned during this parliament because no change would be possible until April 2015.</p><p>Webb said: \"We remain strongly minded to cap pension scheme charges in the default funds used for automatic enrolment. However, we have consistently encouraged firms to start getting ready for automatic enrolment 12 months ahead of the time the new employer duties apply to them.</p><p>\"Therefore, to give those employers at least 12 months' notice of the rules that will apply to them, I can confirm that any cap on charges will not be introduced before April 2015.\"</p><p>It is understood that Webb is adamant that a cap will be imposed on auto-enrolment schemes from April next year. His statement to parliament was written with care because the government is obliged to give the pension providers 12 months' notice of any changes. Government sources said Webb would serve notice this April.</p><p>Webb gave a strong hint of the plans when he said: \"I have seen nothing in the responses to the consultation that changes my view that effective action is needed on pension scheme charges.\"</p><p>Earlier the regulatory policy committee <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/impact-assessment-opinion-charges-in-qualifying-pension-schemes\" title=\"\">dismissed as \"not fit for purpose\"</a> an impact assessment on the changes. McClymont told the Guardian: \"The government's botched consultation has allowed vested interests to nobble the tough action required to  deliver for Britain's savers.\"</p><p>He said the government had let down future pensioners. \"As far as I understand it the pensions minister maintains that he is committed to a charge cap on pensions. But anyone who reads the written ministerial statement smuggled out today by the minister will see that there is no commitment to a charge cap on any timetable.</p><p>\"In fact all there is the suggestion that any charge cap could not be introduced before April 2015. Given that by April 2015 we will be in the midst of one of the toughest-fought election campaigns in living memory it seems unlikely that this cap will ever be imposed in a meaningful fashion.\"</p><p>He added: \"The minister promised, when he launched the charge cap consultation, a full-frontal assault on pension charges. What we have today is a full-scale retreat. This matters not just because the government has said one thing and now appears to be doing something else but because the millions of people who are being enrolled in a pension for the first time now will not have the protection that a properly designed cap could provide.\"</p><p>Labour believes it won the qualified support of an important ally this week when Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor, threw his weight behind calls for more transparent disclosure of pension scheme transaction costs. However, he added that proper disclosure would mean no need for a cap.</p><p>Lawson told peers: \"What I have gone for is compulsory disclosure. In a competitive market, compulsory disclosure will go a very long way towards removing the mischief. If there is proper disclosure, there is no need for a cap or the regulation of charges in the first instance.\"</p><p>He rounded on a call by the Investment Management Association for it to be allowed to write a statement on cost disclosures for fund managers. He said: \"This is ludicrous. You are asking the foxes to regulate the hen coop, as it were.\"</p>","headline":"Cap on pension scheme charges to be announced before election","trailText":"Cap of around 0.75% will be imposed on auto-enrolment schemes from April next year","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m62e","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390507379264/Steve-Webb-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390507379264/Steve-Webb-006.jpg","wordcount":"648","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427882322","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8599278","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nicholas Watt, chief political correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031791","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T20:03:58Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/23/cap-pension-scheme-charges","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jan/23/cap-pension-scheme-charges","tags":[{"id":"money/pensions","webTitle":"Pensions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/pensions","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/pensions","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicholaswatt","webTitle":"Nicholas Watt","rcsId":"GNL004725","r2ContributorId":"16174","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/nick_watt.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nicholas Watt is the Guardian's chief <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics\">political</a> correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaswatt","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nicholaswatt","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427882391","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390507371197/Steve-Webb-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"David Jones","altText":"Steve Webb","height":"54","credit":"David Jones/PA","caption":"Steve Webb, the pensions minister.

The link to the official HMRC website appears further down the page.</p><p></p><p>\"Having googled 'Inland Revenue', the top entry was for 'Tax Return Gateway' and I clicked on that and entered the necessary codes and information. At the end I was told that I owed £230 and I should pay £150 now,\" one reader said.</p><p></p><p>\"Like an idiot I did so, and then I realised I had not been filling in an Inland Revenue form but a form for one of these websites that purport to do a service for you, which you can do yourself.\"</p><p></p><p>Another reader emailed to say: \"It's quite clever really as 95% of the pages you view are official HMRC forms so when they ask you for the money at the end you're fairly well hypnotised into thinking it's for the Inland Revenue in advance of the tax bill.</p><p></p><p>\"If I know two (now three) people within 50 yards of me that have been affected, Lord knows how many there are across the country!\" He has since complained to the Advertising Standards Authority and to Google, \"but I suspect the response will be far too late for most people.\"</p><p></p><p>There are around 2.8m self-assessment forms still to be filed by the 31 January deadline, but HMRC said it could not close down the copycat sites or match the large amounts of money the sites pay to come top of searches.</p><p></p><p>An HMRC spokesman said: \"It costs nothing to file a tax return. Whilst people are entirely free to employ a tax return agent, HMRC does not sanction or in any way approve such sites, and we will take firm action against any websites that suggest otherwise.</p><p></p><p>\"People should steer clear of third-party websites unless they are clear about what they are getting themselves in to and what fees they are going to be charged.\"</p><p></p><p>The only address for Tax Return Gateway and its parent company, Who4 Ltd, is in Clerkenwell, London, but is simply a mail forwarding address. The website has no telephone number and only gives an \"info\" email address. The Guardian asked how many customers have used the site, why it was charging for a service that could be found for free, and if it would offer refunds, but we did not receive a reply.</p><p></p><p>The website appears to conform to Google's rules that require sites to tell viewers they are not the official site and that the service is available for free elsewhere. Below a large text banner that says \"Complete Your Self Assessment Tax Return Online\" and a button that pushes people to \"Submit your tax assessment online now\" there is an italicised message which says in smaller text: \"We are not connected to or affiliated with HMRC, DWP or any other official government body. We offer a bespoke, value for money, tax return assistance service for which we levy a charge.\"</p><p></p><p>Further down the page it also carries a \"Why use our services\" checklist, comparing itself to HMRC, and declares that it is a private company, not an official body. So why do so many people believe they are in the HMRC site?</p><p></p><p>A reader who contacted us on Thursday wrote: \"It's hard to believe that anyone who has followed the Saturday Consumer Champions column in the Guardian for years could do the foolish thing that I did yesterday. I submitted a self-assessment on the above website thinking throughout that I was on an HMRC short-cut site. There was no excuse for this, as I am used to the official website, but I think I was misled by 'Gateway', which is used by HMRC.\"</p><p></p><p>The reader said he had paid £500 on completing the form. \"On reflection, the wording was grossly misleading, indicating that the actual balance of tax due could be more or less than this amount … I am left with the uneasy feeling that this company has all my personal details, income sources etc. The final irony is that when I submitted my self-assessment form on the official site this morning, my tax underpayment was £2.20!\"</p><p></p><p>The value of the website's additional services as \"tax agents\" is unconvincing, say accountants. \"I don't see how they can check for errors if they don't know your situation,\" says Richard Mannion from accountants Smith &amp; Williamson. \"Anyway, filing your return can be very straightforward online and you don't need a tax agent.\"</p><p></p><p>In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: \"We have a strict set of policies which govern what types of ads appear on Google. If we learn that an advertiser is breaching those policies, we move swiftly to take action. We are working closely with Government Digital Services to ensure that ads are not misleading and offer real value.\"</p>","headline":"Self-assessment: taxpayers caught out by 'copycat'

The findings underline the likelihood that politicians will make greater help with childcare a big part of their manifesto pledges at the next election.</p><p>There are growing signs that Labour has decided to make a long-term commitment to universal free childcare one of its two or three most important proposals. The commitment might take more than two parliaments to meet, but these figures underline that childcare is a barrier to full employment.</p><p>Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, has battled to make childcare one of his central issues, but he has had differences within the coalition over the extent of deregulation within the childcare sector.</p><p>Well over a third (37%) of stay-at-home mothers say they would like to work and would hope to do an average of 23 hours a week. And 20% of mothers who are already employed would like to take on an extra 10 hours a week on average.</p><p>Among mothers who are already working, it is those on lower earnings who are more likely to want to take on more hours. The average earnings of those who would like to work more, at approximately £13,000 a year, are less than half those who would not, at approximately £29,000.</p><p>The results come from a survey of nearly 2,000 mothers with children under 10. Respondents were asked about their family makeup, income, childcare arrangements, work preferences and the barriers to work created by childcare, as well as how some of these might change under a different system of childcare support.</p><p>The report also analyses OECD data to show that the UK lags behind some other western economies on rates of maternal employment, with about 67% of mothers in some form of paid work – compared with 86% in the best performer, Slovenia, and behind Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.</p><p>The Resolution Foundation says this relatively low employment rate is a concern, particularly for lower income households, because the risk of poverty for children in families with only one earner is much higher than for those in dual-earner families. There are approximately 5.5 million working mothers of dependent children across the UK, and 2.9 million mothers who do not work.</p><p>The report's other findings include:</p><p>• Childcare costs are named as the biggest single obstacle to more work by more than four in 10 mothers (42% of those in work and 41% of those not working).</p><p>• For working mothers, the next most common barrier to more work is employers being unable or unwilling to offer more hours (cited by 17%).</p><p>• Nations with the best maternal employment rates are more likely than UK employers to offer flexible work options, including the ability to set some of your own hours or to use accumulated hours to earn leave days.</p><p>Justine Roberts, CEO of Mumsnet, said: \"Cost of childcare is clearly proving a real barrier to women working. It's time to start thinking of childcare as infrastructure to the economy in the same way as we think about transport or technology. Enabling women who want to work or who want to work more hours to do so brings real financial benefits to their own family income and also to the wider economy.\"</p><p>The current entitlement to free childcare is 15 hours a week for all parents of children aged three and four. The government is planning a scheme to offer extra support to working parents with younger children, including a tax-free voucher system allowing most better-off parents to claim up to £1,200 towards the cost of looking after a child.</p>","headline":"Cost of childcare is barrier to working more, says two-thirds of mothers","trailText":"Survey finds a third of stay-at-home mothers say they would

But what do you know about the bugs?&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a pop-eyed creature that roams the markets known as the \"gold bug\". A gold bug is someone who believes investing in gold is the answer to all the world's financial anxieties: inflation, a stock market sell-off, the size of the government defict, the prospect of the dollar losing its value.</p> <p>More than any other asset class out there, gold seems to possess the ability to get otherwise level-headed people to toss caution to the winds. Diamonds may shine more brightly; hot technology IPOs usually generate more buzz on the cocktail party circuit, at least. But gold seems to possess a unique kind of luster, one able to blind some of us to logic and common sense.</p> <p>&ldquo;There seems to be a group of true believers in the religion of gold in every generation,&rdquo; says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. &ldquo;They become acolytes, unable to detach themselves emotionally from gold. It can be tough, even impossible, to talk them out of owning it.&rdquo;</p> <p>That&rsquo;s true, Ablin says, even when gold has hit the skids, as it did last year,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304591604579292321014055380\">posting a 28% decline (the largest in more than 30 years)</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>That put an end to a 12-year bull market rally, but not to the dreams of gold bugs everywhere. In their eyes, gold has lost none of its luster. In their eyes, the sell-off isn&rsquo;t simply a function of normal supply and demand factors. (To mention a few: Indian export restrictions, the absence of any inflation, a decline in interest of central banks in holding gold, or the fact that an array of alternatives that started outperforming gold handily.)</p> <p>Instead, the gold bugs believe that the fall of gold&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-17/sprott-manipulation-gold-central-banks-cannot-continue-2014\">is a conspiracy.</a>&nbsp;Global central banks, some gold bugs argue, are manipulating prices and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://usawatchdog.com/what-happens-when-you-have-to-admit-the-golds-not-there-eric-sprott/\">gold will soar to set new records</a>&nbsp;this year.</p> <p>Well, there&rsquo;s at least a small chance that this may be true. And there may have been a shooter on the grassy knoll on 22 November, 1963. But that still isn&rsquo;t an argument in favor of loading up your portfolio with gold.</p> <p>And that&rsquo;s the problem: the fact that at least a small percentage of people will always shun common sense and act instead&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/a-gold-enthusiast-listen-to-the-head--and-history/2014/01/10/d00d6cd2-762d-11e3-b1c5-739e63e9c9a7_story.html\">based instead on a compelling narrative about why gold (or any other investment)</a>&nbsp;is the greatest idea since the wheel.&nbsp;</p> <p>This goes back to a bigger strain of conspiracy theory. The unprecedented involvement of central banks in economies worldwide in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis set the stage for some epic storytelling. All that central bank support &ndash; ultra-low interest rates and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\">\"quantitative easing\"</a> &ndash; would set the stage for hyperinflation and the implosion of the value of the US dollar.</p> <p>Too bad none of that has materialized.</p> <p>The result, for big gold investors, has been that faith has turned into a disaster.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/swiss-central-bank-lost-165-billion-2013-thanks-gold-1527508\">Switzerland's central bank lost billions.</a>&nbsp;Hedge fund billionaire John Paulson, who first revealed his affection for gold in 2009 when the metal had already rallied to about $1,150 an ounce from only $400 or so a decade ago, lost an estimated $300 million on his positions&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-04-13/john-paulson-loses-over-300-million-fridays-gold-tumble\">during trading on a single day last April,</a>&nbsp;and calculating his total losses has become a kind of Wall Street parlor game.&nbsp;</p> <p>Paulson has at least&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324139404579013451946980712\">slashed his exposure to gold.</a>&nbsp;Other gold bugs, however, argue that the current sell-off is a great opportunity to jump in. Goldbugs point out that In Wall Street jargon, gold has a low correlation to other types of investments &ndash; meaning it&rsquo;s likely to zig when other investments zag. The drop in prices has only made goldbugs more faithful, the same way that facts only cause conspiracy theorists to dig in deeper. Sure, gold's value has tanked, but if you can buy it cheaply, all the better, they add. Hope springs eternal. So I wasn&rsquo;t too surprised earlier this week to see Palo Alto-based Merk Investments&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.merkinvestments.com/downloads/2013-12-09-s1-merk-gold-trust.pdf\">announced plans to launch a new gold-backed exchange-traded fund.</a></p> <p>But as BMO Private Bank&rsquo;s Ablin points out, &ldquo;gold has no contractual obligation to come to your rescue in times of trouble.&rdquo; At the height of the financial crisis, the fourth quarter of 2008, stocks in the S&amp;P 500 plunged 22%. Gold did its job, slipping only about 1%. The problem? Treasury bonds were a much better hedge, gaining 14.8% in the same period.&nbsp;</p> <p>As an investor, you can&rsquo;t afford to fall in love with&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>of your investments. When it comes to a particular asset, like gold, it's time to avoid being a true believer and turn agnostic. Especially given that the likes of Goldman Sachs and UBS&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101304875\">predicting further big losses in gold this year</a>. You'll want to keep a clear head and not be dazzled by the hint of shiny, easy money.</p>","headline":"The bug of Wall Street: fools' gold","trailText":"Gold never loses its lustre to some believers, but it's a terrible idea to fall in love with any commodity, and especially this one","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m52z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/22/1390417226419/2a5cb49e-e86e-4571-a544-51c56358e7ce-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/22/1390417226419/2a5cb49e-e86e-4571-a544-51c56358e7ce-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427774696","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e01030e4b07eba157a7a0b","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Suzanne McGee","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-22T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031072","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T13:40:09Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/23/gold-investing-wall-street-banks-value","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jan/23/gold-investing-wall-street-banks-value","tags":[{"id":"money/us-personal-finance","webTitle":"US personal finance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-personal-finance","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/us-personal-finance","references":[]},{"id":"business/gold","webTitle":"Gold","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gold","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/gold","references":[]},{"id":"business/useconomy","webTitle":"US economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/useconomy","references":[]},{"id":"business/investing","webTitle":"Investing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/investing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/investing","references":[]},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/stock-markets","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/suzanne-mcgee","webTitle":"Suzanne McGee","r2ContributorId":"58713","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Suzanne McGee is a financial journalist and the weekly columnist for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us/money\">Money US</a>.

In some cases, payments for the policies reduced workers' pay to below the minimum wage.</p><p></p><p>Responding in the House of Commons, the business secretary, Vince Cable, said the practice was indefensible and possibly illegal, and said the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) would investigate the companies. He did not rule out a broader inquiry into the practice.</p><p></p><p>Umunna said he had evidence that Blue Arrow, Staffline, Acorn, Taskmaster, Randstad and Meridian were all involved in selling personal accident insurance to workers at a profit. Between them they employee more than 100,000 people in jobs around the UK.</p><p></p><p>He told MPs: \"There is even a company, G7 Group, which specialises in putting together these dubious arrangements for agencies.

It is a product that many other organisations offer to their members, including trade unions.</p><p></p><p>\"Personal accident cover can be appropriate for workers in high-risk sectors such as rail and construction, and may also cover them for accidents off-site that would prevent them from working, and provides them with an income whilst off work. By offering these benefits employment agencies are giving temporary workers the same kind of support as that enjoyed by permanent contracted employees.\"</p><p></p><p>But he said the REC had a code of conduct which required agencies to be open and transparent with workers. \"Anyone concerned can contact us, and we have a robust complaints process for handling agency workers' concerns and ensuring agencies are compliant with both the law and best practice.\"</p><p>In a statement, Blue Arrow said it took the welfare of employees very seriously, and that it did not believe anyone had taken out the insurance without fully understanding the benefits and the cost.</p><p></p><p>\"Many [workers] are employed in industrial situations where accidents can happen. We therefore believe that employees should be offered the opportunity to take out personal accident insurance.</p><p></p><p>\"It is important to stress that this insurance is offered, not sold.

We made a 3.2% margin in our retail business in the first nine months of 2013.\"</p><p>The npower chief executive then turned his fire on Miliband, who electrified the Labour party conference last year by saying that he would impose a 20-month freeze on energy prices until 2017 if he won the next general election.</p><p>Massara told the Today programme of Miliband's price freeze pledge: \"It is already having a dramatic effect. What it is doing is freezing investment. People are looking at the UK and saying: 'Do you know what, if they are freezing prices I am not sure I want to invest in that market place. So what is the risk capital that I have for investing?'</p><p>\"We are seeing a dramatic cooling of investment into the UK because of political uncertainty. As we look at our investment plans – and we know this is true for other people – they are looking at the UK and they are saying: 'Hum, what is the political risk around investing now if we have a price freeze?'</p><p>\"We look at every single investment and we decide where that discretionary capital can go. If deciding where we go we think there is a higher political risk because things have changed then absolutely we make a different decision.</p><p>\"Within npower and within RWE we look at that and we say: 'Is this really where we want to put our additional capital?' That is a question we have and our threshold for investment goes up because there is more political risk. We are not the only one.\"</p><p>Massara said the Miliband pledge would work against the interests of consumers. \"It doesn't help consumers. So yes, it is very attractive, it is a great headline to say 'We want to freeze energy prices'. But what is going to happen afterwards? Ed Miliband cannot control the commodity markets, which set 60% of the price.\"</p><p>The npower chief executive agreed that too much energy is used as a luxury as he cited his teenage daughters who leave on lights, iPods and televisions at home. \"I do think we need to change our approach. We do need to think about energy waste,\" he said.</p>","headline":"Miliband energy price freeze pledge is hitting investment – RWE npower boss","trailText":"Paul Massara accuses Labour leader of

I am self-employed but only earn about £10,000 a year. I have few savings but no debts.</p><p>I would like to raise about £50,000 of capital, possibly by remortgaging, to be repaid on my death. I do not want to sell the property to a company which then provides a fixed amount and owns the house on my demise. I have no close family, but I would like to leave some money to friends, relatives and charity. Could you advise me on the options? <strong>MW</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> The cheapest way to raise £50,000 from your home would be to sell it and move somewhere costing £50,000 less than the price you receive for it. However, if you don't want to move, taking out a £50,000 mortgage on your current home could be an option as, according to Moneyfacts, there are a (limited) number of lenders which offer mortgages on an interest-only basis and allow repayment of the loan upon the sale of the property (as would apply in your case).</p><p>However, your age and income could work against you in qualifying for this kind of mortgage, because you need to be able to show that you could afford the interest payments both now and into retirement (when your income is likely to fall). So even if you did succeed in getting a mortgage, you would end up using some of the £50,000 cash to foot the interest bill.</p><p>This would not be the case if you went down the equity release lifetime mortgage route. That is not to say there is no interest charged on an equity release lifetime mortgage, because there is. However, rather than paying the interest each month, it is rolled up and added to the money borrowed and is repaid when the property is sold on your death. The major downside of this is that the interest bill can add a significant amount to the size of the original loan, not least because interest is charged on the loan plus rolled up interest. Which? found that 10 years after taking out a lifetime mortgage of £40,000 with an average fixed interest rate of 6.9%, the amount owed would have more than doubled to just over £80,000.</p><p>If you don't actually need a large lump sum, you can reduce the cost of a lifetime mortgage by opting for a drawdown loan where, instead of taking a lump sum at the start of the loan, you borrow smaller amounts either as you need the cash or on a regular basis. Because you are taking smaller amounts over a period of time, the debt will grow more slowly and the interest charged will be less. But with either type of lifetime mortgage, on the sale of the property there will be a lot less left over for the people and charities you want to leave money to than there would be if you simply moved to a cheaper home.</p><p>The alternative to a lifetime mortgage would be to use a home reversion scheme. This is where you sell a proportion of your home to a reversion company which, when you die and the property is sold, gets that proportion of the sale proceeds. So if you sold 50% of your home, the reversion company would get 50% of the money from the sale. There is no interest charged, but to raise £50,000 you would have to sell a lot more than a 15% share (ie £50,000 as a percentage of £350,000) because the price paid by the reversion company is a lot less than its market value. This is because the price you are paid reflects the fact that you get the right to live in the property for the rest of your life.

It said the average pension pot was estimated to be just £36,800, enough to generate a retirement income of only £1,340 a year on current annuity rates, but an average earner ideally needed savings closer to £240,000.</p><p>The thinktank said it supported automatic enrolment, which aims to get up to 11 million more people saving for their retirement by putting them directly into a workplace pension scheme. This new system is being phased in over several years, with more than 2 million workers already enrolled.</p><p>However, employees are free to leave the scheme if they wish and the opt-out rate has been running at about 9%-10%.</p><p>Policy Exchange warned that even with 8% of earnings flowing into a pension scheme – the minimum contribution under automatic enrolment from 2018 – people would not be able to build  enough for their retirement. It said there should be a new scheme that built on the present system but removed the opt-out, unless the individual could show they had accumulated enough money already.</p><p>Policy Exchange also proposes upping the total minimum contribution from 8% to 12% by requiring a proportion of any increase in someone's pay to be allocated to their pension.</p><p>James Barty, author of the report, said: \"With an ageing population, putting money aside for later life should be seen in the same context as national insurance contributions, taxes and even education - an obligation that falls on everyone in society.\"</p><p>However, many people would argue that they cannot afford to pay into a pension. The Department for Work and Pensions says that for many people, paying into a workplace pension is a good idea even if they have other financial commitments, but <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/workplace-pensions-faq.pdf\" title=\"\">it suggests workers should consider opting out if their finances are not in good shape</a>: \"If you're behind on your mortgage, rent, credit card or other debt payments, a pension might not be the right step at the moment.

There was nothing open back then. Monday to Thursday, all of society went to bed at midnight. Even the television shut down. In those days you worked shifts on a four-week cycle. In the space of five days, your whole system and body clock was completely the wrong way round. I've had doctors say you shouldn't eat at night, but I always took some sandwiches in or stopped by the kebab shop or the local fried chicken place.</p><p>It is physically demanding to try to&nbsp;stay awake all night. You are tired during the day and tired during the night. As I got older, I found it even more difficult to stay awake. By the time you get to the Monday, you're a zombie. You forget appointments, you have to write everything down. The quieter nights were harder.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720863'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390326495763/Graham-Wettone-008.jpg' alt='Graham Wettone' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graham Wettone: 'The biggest problem was digestive – I had loads of stomach upsets.'</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, you don't get a chance to sleep during the day. The rest of society doesn't expect you to sleep. In summer, everyone's out in the garden, cutting grass; you've got the curtains pulled and the earplugs in.</p><p>On the flip side, I loved night duty. The station was ours; no hustle and bustle in the workplace. You could get things done. But I packed it in because it was having an impact on my health. The biggest problem was digestive – I had loads of stomach upsets. It wasn't so much the heart problems or breathlessness the report mentions: I got checked for that, along with other colleagues. After 15 years of working nights, it was a bit of a relief when I stopped. I could almost feel my system saying: \"Thank God that's over, it's back to normal now.\" <strong>PC</strong></p><h2><strong>Kathryn McLaughlin, 30</strong><br /><strong>Burlesque dancer and fire performer</strong><br /></h2><p>I have been working nights for about 10&nbsp;years. The week gets later as it goes on. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, I get to bed about 5am. I have never found it hard to stay awake. When I&nbsp;was little, my mum used to take me to&nbsp;the doctors because I would be up all&nbsp;night reading. I have always been a&nbsp;night owl. Even if I'm not working I&nbsp;wouldn't go to sleep until about 3&nbsp;or&nbsp;4am. I find it easier to do things that require more thought later at&nbsp;night.</p><p>I suspect some of the health effects tie in with the fact that, when you get&nbsp;in late, you are not inclined to sit down and make a proper dinner. I&nbsp;think it's more about making choices to eat something sensible instead of just grabbing something on the go. I&nbsp;have my evening meal between 10.30&nbsp;and 11pm. I go to the gym five times a week.</p><p>For me, this is actually a better way of living: I'm not somebody who functions well at 8 or 9am. When I had a job with more normal hours, I was always drinking Red Bull or eating cheese toasties on my way to work to reward myself for having got up. <strong>PC</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720864'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390326028586/Dr-Zakia-Akhteruzzaman-008.jpg' alt='Dr Zakia Akhteruzzaman' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dr Zakia Akhteruzzaman: 'The most ­difficult thing is no fixed times … it's difficult to have a social life.'</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Dr Zakia Akhteruzzaman, 32</strong><br /><strong>General practitioner </strong><br /></h2><p>\"I worked night shifts on and off for three years when I was a junior doctor, but the worst time was four long months in A&amp;E. It was disorientating. A&amp;E totally messes up your body clock. You have long shifts – 12 or 13 hours – and you have no time to process anything. There's no window in the main emergency room, so you don't know what's happening outside. I felt totally out of touch with the universe. The most difficult thing is that there's no fixed times. One day you do 8am to 5pm and then 8pm to 8am for a few days, and then sometimes till 2am. So every day is different. It's difficult to have a social life, and your body can't adjust.</p><p>You feel very unwell and jetlagged. I&nbsp;could barely talk sometimes. I would be seeing a patient and taking down their history, and then would have to go to the toilet and cough up phlegm. Twice when I was on night shift I had to take time off as I was sick in bed. I&nbsp;remember feeling really guilty.</p><p>When we qualified, there were some doctors who wanted to do A&amp;E, mainly because they enjoyed acute medicine and the associated adrenaline rush, but it wasn't for me. I don't see how you could have any work/life balance and work those shifts.</p><p>But as difficult as it was, I also remember it with some nostalgia. It&nbsp;sounds strange, but hospitals can be peaceful at that time. During the day, the patients are in the corridor and there are doctors huddling. But at night, it's often just you walking along the corridors. We would have really deep conversations at that time – even discussing spirituality and deeper issues. I&nbsp;have never found that during the day. I think people feel a bit more vulnerable and open up more. Also, another positive thing is that at this time you really get a chance to bond. Sometimes the junior handles the shop floor while the senior is asleep or does some paperwork, and so the motherly nurses – especially on paediatrics – would look out for juniors and would make a bed and say: \"It's quiet now, get some sleep.\" <strong>AG</strong></p><h2><strong>Lucy Horsfall, 34</strong><br /><strong>Senior cabin crew</strong><br /></h2><p>I have been doing this for 11 years. It's my job, and you just fight through it. The challenge is going through time zones. Coming back from Los Angeles, it's dark and then you see the dawn rising through the clouds – and in the cockpit they say we haven't even got to New York. I tell myself it's still night, keep the window blinds down. I think that's the only way I can deal with it.</p><p>My airline is very good. It gives us the correct rest. You get allotted a break time on the long flights and you have a bunk you can sleep in. The minimum rest is three hours. That really helps – you can actually fall asleep. The hardest part is at about 2.30 or 3am, when you start getting really cold. That's when I get most tired. It's a really heady feeling when we land in the morning. But an hour or two later you get a real crash and start to feel sick. Diet-wise, it can be tricky. You're craving sugar through the evening, eating chocolate or whatever's around. You're eating dinner at 3am just to get a sugar hit.</p><p>I suppose you could get depressed if you worked on your own through the night. You could start thinking about things. But I have got a team around me. We'll have a chat, a cup of coffee, and if one person's tired we'll go and do something like cleaning: it's just a little thing, but it takes your mind off it.</p><p>I've never had anything wrong with me, other than tiredness and jetlag. When I come back from maternity leave I'll still be doing night shifts, but I'll be part-time – two or three long-haul flights a month. <strong>PC</strong></p><h2><strong>Alex Lester, 57</strong><br /><strong>BBC Radio 2 DJ</strong><br /></h2><p>I've been doing night shifts for 26 years and I'm still alive, so hopefully it's all right. It just turns your day on its head, that's all.</p><p>The downsides are mainly social. I&nbsp;play a lot of music, and I'm always looking out for new stuff, so I get invited to a lot of concerts, and I have to say: \"I'm sorry, but unless it's a Beatles reunion with all the original members I won't be able to make it.\" They say: \"The band are on stage at 9.30.\" And I go: \"Er, I'll have been in bed for two hours.\"</p><p>There are upsides, though. I don't get stuck in the rush hour. I don't get stuck in crowds, so during the day I can do things while everyone's at work. My&nbsp;Christmas shopping is usually done&nbsp;before everybody else's.</p><p>During the first few months I had a&nbsp;bit of trouble sleeping. There's this figure eight hours that's been plucked from somewhere, and when I started working nights I would go to bed thinking, \"I must get my eight hours!\", and then lie awake all night worrying about getting the amount of sleep I needed. People worry far too much about that, but your body will tell you how much you need.</p><p>Once you are doing night shifts on a permanent basis, your body clock sort of adjusts. So I'm now a nocturnal creature. I tend to go to bed at 7.30 in the evening and then get up at one in the morning and go to work. Then I'm back in bed again by about six in the morning and tend to be asleep until 10&nbsp;or 10.30am. That's the way my body clock works. I'm hoping that it won't have any long-term health effects. I'd have thought I would have noticed it by now if it did. <strong>TM</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390326685205/Simon-Matthews-008.jpg' alt='Simon Matthews' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Simon Matthews: 'There’s a different atmosphere at night; it’s nicer.'</figcaption></figure><h2>Simon Matthews, 48<br />Freelance lorry driver<br /></h2><p>Night working is a damn sight easier than day work. At night, there's far less traffic on the road, especially in the summer. There is something peaceful about it: you're totally on your own, with nice open road most of the time. Serenity is a good word. There's a different atmosphere at night; it's nicer. People aren't so stressed. Probably because the rest of the world is sleeping.</p><p>I don't do many nights any more because I'm semi-retired, but I never really had a problem staying awake. Your body clock seems to be set so that it wants to shut down around 2.30 or 3 in the morning. Your body temperature goes down, but I don't really ever seem to want to go to sleep.</p><p>The longest stint of night shifts I have done, without day shifts between, was eight weeks. I was carrying chilled food products. It was a similar journey every night, from Taunton up to Oxford, down to Southampton and then back to Taunton. I felt as if I was permanently in a different time zone. It affects your head. You feel totally out of sorts coming off nights and then having to live a day life for two days, and then going back on to nights again. I imagine it would have very detrimental effects on you, especially mentally <strong>PC</strong></p><h2>Torgeir Fotland, 33 <br />Former psychiatric nursing assistant<br /></h2><p>I did this temping job in Oslo in 2010 and 2011. There were three of us working from 10pm to 8am, making sure that patients were asleep and taking care of them if they needed to get up. We were just waiting there in case something happened. That made it harder to stay awake. The others brought in their computers or were in front of the TV or reading. They had some sort of activity which occupied them privately. I was a bit miffed, thinking: just sitting here looking at a wall, I might fall asleep in five minutes. I was working with guys who had done it for decades. They had their routine. I spent a lot of time on YouTube – I don't know how people survived this job before the internet.</p><p>You're fine until midnight, even sociable. Two comes, three. And then you become cold. You'd be sitting there at 4am, saying: \"This is not good for the health is it?\" \"No, definitely not.\" \"How long are you intending to do it?\" \"A while. Better pay.\"</p><p>For me, it was a temporary thing. But looking at my colleagues, the regular staff, they had a routine. They had done it for 20 or 30 years. I don't think that can be good. You miss out on life; you don't really see people; you are on the outside of society. I'm on the same bus as everyone else, but they're going to work and I'm going home. They look fresh and I look like I just killed someone. I couldn't do it for long without thinking: what's going on out there in the world? <strong>PC</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720866'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390330109635/Dan-Doherty-011.jpg' alt='Dan Doherty' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dan Doherty: 'The atmosphere in a 24-hour restaurant can be … interesting.'</figcaption></figure><h2>Zdenek Honsa, 35<br />Engineer<br /></h2><p>I have just changed jobs so as not to work nights. For 18 months I worked as an engineer on the London Eye – mostly maintenance, fixing things that had broken during the day. I worked a 12-hour shift, 8pm to 8am. I didn't find it hard to stay awake, but it used to take a week to get back to normal. It doesn't surprise me that there may be long-term health effects. I hope I didn't do it for long enough to matter. I felt very tired. If I got five hours' sleep that would be really good. Sometimes it would be four or less, and often not in one go. I also noticed that my digestion went quite funny.</p><p>It was nice to get to see the city at night though. It was quite special on the London Eye. Even the commuting was quite nice in the dark. Going over Waterloo Bridge was lovely. And I could see my son during the day more. If I had a choice, I wouldn't do nights again. But sometimes you can't pick jobs. <strong>PC</strong></p><h2>Dan Doherty, 29<br />Executive chef at Duck and Waffle 24-hour restaurant<br /></h2><p>It's surreal, that's the only way I can describe it. Working an eight-hour shift from 10pm to 6am is so much more different from eight hours in the day. I do both throughout the week – post-midnight dining is an integral part of our business – and so my body is in a permanent state of jetlag. At 2am, you get more celebrities; footballers on one table, Made in Chelsea on another. There's also travellers on different time zones and couples on dates. It's always strange because all the signals that normally dictate you leaving a restaurant – catching the last tube, the waiters clearing up – don't apply and the atmosphere can be … interesting.</p><p>I do like it, but if you don't plan it properly, not seeing sunlight can have an adverse affect on your personality – it's not normal, is it? It goes against everything our bodies do. I'm more spaced out. You eat too much, the same way you do when you travel, and it can make you feel gross. You're constantly dull-eyed and because I mix it up and it's not routine, my sleeping patterns are entirely random. My wife works normal hours and I try to cook when I get in so we can at least have breakfast together but even that's hard – I want sausages and mash after a night shift ends at 6am, not eggs or pastries.</p><p>The upside? Sunrise is the most beautiful time to drive through London. <strong>NI</strong></p><h2>Peter Collins, 33<br />Spacecraft engineer <br /></h2><p>I work as part of what we call the flight control team at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt in Germany. I'm currently working on a mission called Gaia, which is a star mapper. It was launched in December and is travelling to a point which is 1.5m km from the Earth in the opposite direction to the sun. From there, it will map our galaxy, the Milky Way.</p><p>My particular area is the power and thermal systems on Gaia. I have to make sure the spacecraft's got enough power; that the solar array is working as it should; the distribution of the power through the spacecraft's working; and, on the thermal side, that everything is in the right thermal ranges.</p><p>In the first few months after the mission has launched it's quite intense. The first few days are critical. Once we've launched, for the week following the launch, we're in 12-hour shifts. So you're often working through the night. For those four or five days you basically just eat, sleep and work. You get into just working and not really knowing what time of day it is.</p><p>It's totally worth it for me, but then I don't have to do it for years and years and years. We have what are called spacecraft controllers, who come in when the mission is up and running. They have to be there the whole time to make sure the spacecraft is working. They're on their own in the control room overnight, day in, day out, night in, night out, which must be tough. It's not something I could do, because of the loneliness. Personally, I think it's being on your own for the whole time that would have an effect on your health; it's losing touch a bit of what's going on around you because you're so focused on work.</p><p>In my case, I don't think working nights has had a lasting effect on my health, but during the period that I'm doing it I would say my home life was affected, in that all I was doing was going home to eat, sleep, get up and go back to work again. My wife does a similar job, elsewhere at ESOC. It will be the same for her in a couple of years when her mission launches, but we both understand that it's only a short-term thing. <strong>TM</strong></p>","headline":"Is working night shifts bad for you?","trailText":"<p>A new study claims that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25812422\" title=\"\">working nights can disrupt gene activity</a> after only three days – and the health dangers are thought to include an increased risk of breast cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart attacks.

Expert Marc Pitman tells us how to avoid alienating friends</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-01-21T17:10:00.418Z","body":"<p>The fundraising season is upon us. Every new year, people inevitably become interested in both improving their oxygen uptake and improving their world by raising money for variety of walks, races, triathlons and marathons coming up.</p> <p>Yet asking people for money is awkward, unless you're a politician. Expect fundraising to be hard work, says Marc Pitman, author of <a href=\"http://fundraisingcoach.com/ask-without-fear/\">Ask Without Fear!</a>&nbsp;and founder of <a href=\"http://fundraisingcoach.com/\">FundraisingCoach.com</a>. You have to earn every dollar. Don&rsquo;t think that people owe you or your cause anything. Rather, make people part of your cause. Draw them in and recognize what their contribution means.</p> <p>Here are a few tips on how to raise money without hurting your cause.</p> <h2>Believe in your cause&nbsp;</h2> <p>The key to hooking your donors is to make them care about your cause. Research it, make sure you believe the cause is worth contributing to, and then figure out how the money will help. This way, instead of sending out a formal email asking for money, you can make it sound like what it is: a chance for people to make a difference. It helps if you can share a personal experience.</p> <p>&ldquo;We live in a transactional society. So, asking for money without giving anything in return feels weird to the asker,&rdquo; says Pitman. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way to the giver.&rdquo;</p> <p>People like contributing to a good cause. It makes them feel good. &ldquo;Fundraising is emotional, just like shopping,&rdquo; he explains. The main thing you should remember when making your pitch is to make donor the hero:&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a hero for doing this walk/marathon. You are the hero, because of your generous donation &hellip;&rdquo;</p> <p>Be careful not to buy into the myth of donors fatigue, says Pitman:&nbsp;&ldquo;People are not tired of being asked for money. They&rsquo;re tired of being asked poorly.&rdquo;</p> <p>Try putting yourself in their shoes &ndash; you don't want to be just another person asking for money. Another mistake to avoid is&nbsp;lumping all your donors into one category by asking them all for the same donation.</p> <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to leave money on table with some people and overreach with others,&rdquo; Pitman says.</p> <h2>Ask the right people</h2> <p>Most often, people begin fundraising by asking their friends and families. As you make your pitch, you should also ask if they know anyone else who would like to support your cause.</p> <p>It is the next step, however, that can get tricky: asking your co-workers. Asking your co-workers for money can &ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thebillfold.com/2014/01/possible-responses-to-my-bosss-email-asking-for-donations-to-his-marathon-training-team-for-cancer/\">and has</a>&nbsp;&ndash; bring into question the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/the-office-shakedown.html?_r=0\">issue of propriety</a>. To avoid running into any trouble, you ought to &ldquo;check your workplace policies. Don&rsquo;t assume it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; says Pitman.</p> <p>Some companies nurture a more charitable culture and even have corporate matching gifts programs. However, others do not.&nbsp;Rather than sending a company wide email, you might bring it up in conversation, face to face. Or you could talk to your boss about other ways to raise money within the office, such as holding a bake sale.</p> <p>&ldquo;The things you can offer are only limited by your imagination,&rdquo; says Pitman. &ldquo;The more fun you can have with it, the easier it will be.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Take it online</h2> <p>If you are active on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, you might want to take your fundraising efforts online. Individuals have a better luck fundraising on social media, says Pitman.</p> <p>If you do decide to go down this route, there are few things you need to keep in mind.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> People have a very short attention span when it comes to internet, so donating money has &ldquo;got to be easy&rdquo;, says Pitman.</li> <li><strong>Pick a magic number.</strong> Unlike with emails, you should set a specific amount when fundraising on social media.</li> <li><strong>Take me straight there.</strong> All outreach &ndash; tweets and status updates &ndash; should include an easy link that takes potential donors directly to your donations page.</li> <li><strong>Engage.</strong> &ldquo;You should approach fundraising on social media like a special event,&rdquo; recommends Pitman. Set a deadline. Organize a fundraising committee. Let your social community know your goal: We want to raise so many dollars in so many days. Help us reach our goal.</li> </ul> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-edc3510b-ff7d-4e5e-8412-460093aba3ac\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389981405244/4917f04d-1b03-49eb-bca8-991b7546a23d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thank you\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Don't forget to thank your donors. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Give thanks</h2> <p>You should thank your donors for their contributions, says Pitman. \"Just like Grandma said &ndash; always say thank you.\"</p> <p>While the fundraising industry standard is 24-48 hours, personal campaigns have a more flexible grace period. You can thank your donors right after their contributions as well as after you reach your goal. Remember: Make hero of the donor. &ldquo;Thanks to you, 30 children can go to camp this year.&rdquo;</p> <p>Not only is it simply polite to say thank you, but maintaining contact with your donors will make future fundraising easier, says Pitman. Next time around, all you have to do is to remind them how much they helped the first time around and ask if they could do so again.</p> <h2>Have you led a successful fundraising campaign before?

Between April and June 2008, 13% of the economically active population aged 18-24 was unemployed, a figure that had increased to 19% by the same period of 2013.</p><p>The percentage of unemployed people who live with their parents (13%) is more than twice that (6%) of those who live independently.</p><p>The increase in the number of young adults living with parents also coincides with a period in which house prices rose relative to incomes. In 1996, the typical first-time buyer had to raise 2.7 times their salary to afford to buy a home, but by 2013 the figure stood at 4.47. This, combined with stricter mortgage criteria and rising private rents, is likely to have driven more young adults back to the family home.</p><p>Matthew Pointon, housing economist at Capital Economics, said it was no surprise the increase had coincided with the economic downturn.</p><p>\"The recession hit the young particularly hard, with a sharp rise in youth unemployment. Furthermore, there was a collapse in the availability of mortgages for buyers with small deposits, which prevented many would-be first-time buyers from flying the nest,\" he said. </p><p>\"With lenders demanding a deposit of at least 25%, and with savings rates at record lows, many young buyers desperate to get on the housing ladder would have seen staying with their parents a little longer to boost their savings as their only option.\"</p><p>Matt Griffith, an associate fellow at the IPPR thinktank who has written on housing policy, said the figures highlighted a political failure in dealing with housing. \"Short-term recession-related unemployment is colliding with long-term housing failure to create intense pressures on young people and their housing choices. We are seeing a regression towards much less mobile households as a result,\" he said.  </p><p>\"Unfortunately, up until now, the policies we need to address this – much greater levels of housebuilding and reining in excessive housing demand – are seen as upsetting that more powerful generational political force: older voters. The silver lining is that housing costs are now so absurd we are starting to see a recognition across all groups that things really do need to change.\"</p><p>Neil Hudson, associate director of residential research at estate agency Savills, said the housing market was already working against young people before the downturn began. \"First-time buyer numbers started to drop-off in 2003 suggesting that by that point the market was beginning to get a bit too expensive for many younger people; it was at that time that the buy-to-let sector really began to rise too,\" he said. \"We also saw younger people starting to come out of university with more student debt.\" Hudson said parents who were able to put up their adult children were acting as a \"pressure valve\" on the rental sector, where the average cost of housing is more than £800 a month. \"People can think 'I may lose a bit of my social life but I will save a lot of money if I move back in with my parents',\" he said.</p><p>The ONS said that in 1996, the typical first-time buyer had to raise 2.7 times their salary to afford to buy a home, but by 2013 the figure stood at 4.47.  </p><p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said the figures wouldn't be a surprise \"to the thousands of hard-working young people still living in their childhood bedroom\". He added: \"The government already knows that it needs to meet people halfway and give hard-working young people the chance to put down roots in a stable home of their own. Now it has to get serious about the chronic shortage of affordable homes and make building a priority, rather than pumping more taxpayers' money into mortgage guarantee schemes.\"</p><p>Christine Northam, a counsellor at the advice charity Relate, said the change was also putting pressure on parents who had expected their children to move out when they went into higher education. \"It's a role change, people may have to learn to cope with living with an adult child. If the couple aren't very good at adapting it can be difficult,\" she said. \"Couples who had held on for the sake of the children find that they are holding on for longer.\"</p><p>A breakdown of the figures along gender lines showed that for every 10 women aged 20-34 who lived with their parents in 2013, 17 men did so. The ONS said this substantial difference could be explained by looking at the living situations of young adults.</p><p>\"In the 20-34 age group, over 600,000 more women than men were living as part of a couple in their own household,\" it said. \"The main reason for this is that, on average, women form partnerships with men older than themselves. Thus more women than men in this age group were married or cohabiting.\"</p><p>In addition, 589,000 more women than men were lone parents in their own household, and women were more likely to take part in higher education than men, leving the family home to do so.</p><p>The ONS also compared UK data with figures from Europe, and said that in many EU countries young adults were more likely to live with their parents.</p><p>In the UK, 15% of 25- to 34-year-olds are in the family home, and the proprtion is lower in just six of the 28 countries of the European Union. In Denmark the figure was just 2%, but in Croatia it reached 68%.</p><h2>Case study</h2><p>Katrina Parmiter, 26, and her fiance Harry Orford, 25, moved in with his mother, Maxine, and two younger sisters last August after living together in a rented home. Their plan was to save up for their wedding this July and for a home. </p><p>It has not gone quite as they hoped, says Katrina: \"Sadly, a good portion of our income seems to go on outings and activities to keep us out of the house. It's not as though we don't all get along – they are fabulous and so welcoming – but the adjustment from our own space to someone else's has been more difficult than anticipated.\" </p><p>Katrina, an accountant, says it has been hard to get used to using someone else's things after time in her own home, and that she feels much more obliged to wash up quickly and be tidy. \"Basically, I miss the opportunity to be lazy,\" she says. </p><p>The couple pay rent and contribute to food bills, and have put their furniture in storage, so they are still a way off raising the money to buy in Bridport, Dorset, which has been dubbed \"Notting Hill on Sea\" because of its popularity with London buyers. </p><p>\"Not a lot of property comes on the market here for under £200,000,\" says Katrina. \"There are a lot of people who I went to sixth form with who just can't afford to live here.\" She and Harry have decided that once they are married they will move into rented accommodation again. The couple were spending £525 a month renting a home in the town but when the tenancy came up they decided to approach Harry's mum and ask if they could move in. Harry says it was a culture shock after almost four years away from the family home. As well as living with his mum, he  works with her but he says she is \"quite good at giving us our own space\".</p><p>Maxine is thrilled to have all of her children back at home. \"I love it,\" she says. \"I think it's a great compliment that they wanted to come back – they could have found an alternative. I enjoy having them around the house.\"</p><p>She says she has not set any house rules. \"I did all that when they were growing up.

Carney vows to keep cost of borrowing at record low 0.5% despite policy linking a rate rise to a sharp fall in unemployment","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T08:54:57Z","body":"<p>An early increase in borrowing costs was ruled out by the governor of the Bank of England as he insisted that this week's faster than expected fall in unemployment will not lead to an automatic interest rate rise that might choke off the recovery.</p><p>All but burying his \"forward guidance\" policy of linking an interest rate rise to a fall in the rate of unemployment to 7%, Mark Carney vowed to keep borrowing costs at their record low of 0.5% for the time being. He was speaking a day after it emerged that the unemployment rate fell to 7.1%.</p><p>Interviewed on BBC's Newsnight, Carney rejected the idea that plunging unemployment was a headache for the Bank. \"If our forecast is going to be wrong it's better to be wrong in that direction,\" he said.</p><p>Carney also said that when the Bank decided to raise interest rates for the first time since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, the moves would be gradual.</p><p>Economists have warned that a rise to around 3% in the interest rate would lead to huge increases in mortgage costs and a wave of repossessions, as well as damage business.</p><p>Downing Street and the Treasury have been looking nervously at the politically unpredictable consequences of repeated small interest rate rises before the general election in May 2015.</p><p>Although the Treasury maintains that an interest rate rise would help savers and be a sign of an economy returning to normality, No 10 is more ambivalent.</p><p>Downing Street feels assured that Carney is a practical Bank governor driven by the state of the real economy, unlike his more academic predecessor Mervyn King.</p><p>The governor said the Bank's monetary policy committee would be looking at all aspects of the labour market and not just the unemployment rate. The MPC had used the 7% figure to enshrine the idea that joblessness would have to fall considerably before he would \"even begin to think about\" raising borrowing costs.</p><p>Some City analysts are expecting Carney to announce in the next few months that he will lower the threshold at which the Bank would consider raising interest rates to an unemployment level of 6.5%.</p><p>The governor said that would be decided by the MPC but added that it was \"really about overall conditions in the whole labour market\", where productivity remains poor and many people working part-time still want full-time jobs.</p><p>Carney said the economy was \"coming off a low base\" and output was still below the levels when the economy dropped into its deepest recession since the second world war.</p><p>\"The worst of the crisis is behind us but the financial system is not functioning as well as it could,\" he said. \"Uncertainty among households and businesses is still preventing investment.\"</p><p>No 10 remains convinced that a year of growth, so long as it does not tip into over-heating, will ensure Labour's stubborn opinion poll lead is worn down into 2015.</p><p>Although David Cameron  urged voters to be patient on living standards, his aides believe average incomes, once tax changes are taken into account, are already starting to rise above prices.</p><p>In a speech to business people in Davos, Switzerland,  the prime minister will try to present his most optimistic long-term vision of the UK economy for many years , saying Britain can become \"the re-shore nation\" with businesses bringing production back to the UK, encouraged by cheaper energy costs and the lure of shorter customer chains.</p><p>Cameron will hold out the example of  the United States where collapsing energy costs owing to fracking have led businesses to relocate back to the US.</p><p>He will say: \"There is no doubt that when it comes to reshoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade.</p><p>\"I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the Reshore Nation.\"</p><p>Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"The Tory-led government came to office promising an export-led recovery but the UK's trade deficit is growing. Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back.</p><p>\"But after so many government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice.\"</p><p>Cameron's hopes for a boom built on fracking are not shared by the energy department, which is much more ambivalent about the ability of Britain – for geological, political and environmental reasons – to match the US fracking boom, at least not for more than a decade.</p><p>The prime minister will try to rebut internal critics tired of the Tory party's negativity by striking a more optimistic note. He will say: \"For years the west has been written off. People say we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more.</p><p>\"Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision – the east wins while the west loses, and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way. If we make the right decisions, we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from east to west.\"</p><p>To back the rhetoric, UK Trade &amp; Investment will join forces with the Manufacturing Advisory Service to launch Reshore UK, a service to help companies bring production back to Britain.</p>","headline":"Bank

Gregg McClymont, the shadow pensions minister, said a \"botched\" consultation by Webb would deprive future pensioners of tens of thousands of pounds.</p><p>McClymont spoke out after Webb appeared to suggest in a written ministerial statement that a cap had been abandoned during this parliament because no change would be possible until April 2015.</p><p>Webb said: \"We remain strongly minded to cap pension scheme charges in the default funds used for automatic enrolment. However, we have consistently encouraged firms to start getting ready for automatic enrolment 12 months ahead of the time the new employer duties apply to them.</p><p>\"Therefore, to give those employers at least 12 months' notice of the rules that will apply to them, I can confirm that any cap on charges will not be introduced before April 2015.\"</p><p>It is understood that Webb is adamant that a cap will be imposed on auto-enrolment schemes from April next year. His statement to parliament was written with care because the government is obliged to give the pension providers 12 months' notice of any changes. Government sources said Webb would serve notice this April.</p><p>Webb gave a strong hint of the plans when he said: \"I have seen nothing in the responses to the consultation that changes my view that effective action is needed on pension scheme charges.\"</p><p>Earlier the regulatory policy committee <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/impact-assessment-opinion-charges-in-qualifying-pension-schemes\" title=\"\">dismissed as \"not fit for purpose\"</a> an impact assessment on the changes. McClymont told the Guardian: \"The government's botched consultation has allowed vested interests to nobble the tough action required to  deliver for Britain's savers.\"</p><p>He said the government had let down future pensioners. \"As far as I understand it the pensions minister maintains that he is committed to a charge cap on pensions. But anyone who reads the written ministerial statement smuggled out today by the minister will see that there is no commitment to a charge cap on any timetable.</p><p>\"In fact all there is the suggestion that any charge cap could not be introduced before April 2015. Given that by April 2015 we will be in the midst of one of the toughest-fought election campaigns in living memory it seems unlikely that this cap will ever be imposed in a meaningful fashion.\"</p><p>He added: \"The minister promised, when he launched the charge cap consultation, a full-frontal assault on pension charges. What we have today is a full-scale retreat. This matters not just because the government has said one thing and now appears to be doing something else but because the millions of people who are being enrolled in a pension for the first time now will not have the protection that a properly designed cap could provide.\"</p><p>Labour believes it won the qualified support of an important ally this week when Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor, threw his weight behind calls for more transparent disclosure of pension scheme transaction costs. However, he added that proper disclosure would mean no need for a cap.</p><p>Lawson told peers: \"What I have gone for is compulsory disclosure. In a competitive market, compulsory disclosure will go a very long way towards removing the mischief. If there is proper disclosure, there is no need for a cap or the regulation of charges in the first instance.\"</p><p>He rounded on a call by the Investment Management Association for it to be allowed to write a statement on cost disclosures for fund managers. He said: \"This is ludicrous. You are asking the foxes to regulate the hen coop, as it were.\"</p>","headline":"Cap on pension scheme charges to be announced before election","trailText":"Cap of around 0.75% will be imposed on auto-enrolment schemes from April next year","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m62e","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390507379264/Steve-Webb-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390507379264/Steve-Webb-006.jpg","wordcount":"648","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427882322","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8599278","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nicholas Watt, chief political correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031791","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T20:03:58Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/23/cap-pension-scheme-charges","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jan/23/cap-pension-scheme-charges","tags":[{"id":"money/pensions","webTitle":"Pensions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/pensions","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/pensions","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nicholaswatt","webTitle":"Nicholas Watt","rcsId":"GNL004725","r2ContributorId":"16174","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/nick_watt.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nicholas Watt is the Guardian's chief <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics\">political</a> correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaswatt","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nicholaswatt","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427882391","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390507371197/Steve-Webb-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"David Jones","altText":"Steve Webb","height":"54","credit":"David Jones/PA","caption":"Steve Webb, the pensions minister.

The findings underline the likelihood that politicians will make greater help with childcare a big part of their manifesto pledges at the next election.</p><p>There are growing signs that Labour has decided to make a long-term commitment to universal free childcare one of its two or three most important proposals. The commitment might take more than two parliaments to meet, but these figures underline that childcare is a barrier to full employment.</p><p>Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, has battled to make childcare one of his central issues, but he has had differences within the coalition over the extent of deregulation within the childcare sector.</p><p>Well over a third (37%) of stay-at-home mothers say they would like to work and would hope to do an average of 23 hours a week. And 20% of mothers who are already employed would like to take on an extra 10 hours a week on average.</p><p>Among mothers who are already working, it is those on lower earnings who are more likely to want to take on more hours. The average earnings of those who would like to work more, at approximately £13,000 a year, are less than half those who would not, at approximately £29,000.</p><p>The results come from a survey of nearly 2,000 mothers with children under 10. Respondents were asked about their family makeup, income, childcare arrangements, work preferences and the barriers to work created by childcare, as well as how some of these might change under a different system of childcare support.</p><p>The report also analyses OECD data to show that the UK lags behind some other western economies on rates of maternal employment, with about 67% of mothers in some form of paid work – compared with 86% in the best performer, Slovenia, and behind Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.</p><p>The Resolution Foundation says this relatively low employment rate is a concern, particularly for lower income households, because the risk of poverty for children in families with only one earner is much higher than for those in dual-earner families. There are approximately 5.5 million working mothers of dependent children across the UK, and 2.9 million mothers who do not work.</p><p>The report's other findings include:</p><p>• Childcare costs are named as the biggest single obstacle to more work by more than four in 10 mothers (42% of those in work and 41% of those not working).</p><p>• For working mothers, the next most common barrier to more work is employers being unable or unwilling to offer more hours (cited by 17%).</p><p>• Nations with the best maternal employment rates are more likely than UK employers to offer flexible work options, including the ability to set some of your own hours or to use accumulated hours to earn leave days.</p><p>Justine Roberts, CEO of Mumsnet, said: \"Cost of childcare is clearly proving a real barrier to women working. It's time to start thinking of childcare as infrastructure to the economy in the same way as we think about transport or technology. Enabling women who want to work or who want to work more hours to do so brings real financial benefits to their own family income and also to the wider economy.\"</p><p>The current entitlement to free childcare is 15 hours a week for all parents of children aged three and four. The government is planning a scheme to offer extra support to working parents with younger children, including a tax-free voucher system allowing most better-off parents to claim up to £1,200 towards the cost of looking after a child.</p>","headline":"Cost of childcare is barrier to working more, says two-thirds of mothers","trailText":"Survey finds a third of stay-at-home mothers say they would

Of all the dark places, nowhere is more obscure than inside the black box of pension funds. Virtually no one understands their pension scheme. Even those who think they do can't know what is shrouded in secrecy: the real charges paid over a lifetime, hidden in the dark where City burglars prosper.</p><p>Yesterday, faced with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25860239\" title=\"\">mass obstruction of the pensions industry</a> – in effect the entire City – the government beat a hasty retreat. Sneaking out a written statement and avoiding questions, Steve Webb, the pensions minister, backed away from capping the charges imposed by pension funds, most of them secret. To understand the full force of this U-turn, here's what Webb boldly announced last October: he would conduct <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/29/pensions-minister-full-frontal-assault-rip-off-schemes-webb\" title=\"\">\"a full frontal assault\" on the pensions industry</a>. He calculated someone saving £100 a month all their working life could see \"the huge sum of £160,000\" lost in charges. \"Enough is enough,\" he said, urging \"an outright ban on all charges above 0.75%\".</p><p>That too was a U-turn. Ed <a href=\"http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/miliband-attacks-pension-and-bank-charges/1044559.article\" title=\"\">Miliband named pension funds in his attack on \"predatory capitalism\"</a>, warning charges were the next big scandal, with a cartel of just four insurers controlling 70% of the industry in myriad schemes. The Association of British Insurers protested that his \"scaremongering about charges runs the risk of putting off many people from saving into a pension.\" Webb agreed, calling Miliband \"irresponsible\" for \"stirring up cheap headlines\", sneering: <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2013/10/building-a-pensions-system-people-can-trust-another-victory-for-labour/\" title=\"\">\"Why doesn't the government set a price cap on a tin of beans?\"</a></p><p>But he abruptly spun round as the wind changed with a surge of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/19/oft-retirement-savings-poor-value-pension-schemes\" title=\"\">pensions critics, including the Office of Fair Trading</a>, some leading Tories and a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-369633/Pensions-A-crisis.html\" title=\"\">campaign in the Daily Mail</a>. With new reforming zeal, Webb compared pension companies to the innkeeper in Les Misérables – \"<a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/liblink-steve-webb-issue-of-pension-charges-has-been-neglected-for-too-long-36980.html\" title=\"\">Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice, two per cent for looking in the mirror twice</a>\" – as he accused them of \"ever more inventive ways of extracting money from their clients\". He quoted the OFT's discovery of <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oft.gov.uk%2Fshared_oft%2Fmarket-studies%2Foft1505&amp;ei=oGDhUsz-FseN7AaEu4HwBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGi3ayVAZJ5rXhiAOM2sixHaOAs2w&amp;sig2=--b3aKQkhIr4F6pk-sLX1Q&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.ZGU\" title=\"\">18 different sorts of charges</a> as fund managers churn shares to skim commissions.</p><p>But the pension funds have had the last laugh, with Webb's sheepish statement that, contrary to his promise, \"any cap on charges will not be introduced before April 2015\". No one thinks he will introduce them in the middle of an election campaign, either. It's a dead duck on the dust heap of Department for Work and Pensions disasters. Responding to U-turn headlines, the DWP hastened out another statement late yesterday: in April 2015 there will be a cap, size unknown, but only on auto-enrolled pensions.</p><p>Here's why this matters more than ever. Auto-enrolment – relying on inertia to enrol every employee into a pension scheme – is already being rolled out. Sharp-eyed critics warn this may become a <a href=\"http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/tory-mp-fears-auto-enrolment-misselling-scandal/1059335.article\" title=\"\">massive mis-selling scandal</a>, as the low-paid find hidden charges eating up their small pensions. Many risk no gain at all if their pension falls below the threshold for the minimum pension guarantee when they retire, losing everything. The only gainers will be the government and the pensions industry. That's grand theft mis-selling.</p><p>Miliband will return to his first critique of the industry, aided by Gregg McClymont, his astute pensions shadow minister, who has relentlessly dogged Steve Webb through the labyrinthine pensions undergrowth. Calling pensions  a \"broken market\", McClymont presciently predicted that the government would never stand up to this greatest of vested interests.</p><p>Drawing up their own policy, Labour should study a <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/publications/reports/costly-and-ineffective-why-pension-tax-reliefs-should-be-reformed/\" title=\"\">radical paper by Michael Johnson – former Cameron policy adviser and investment banker turned gamekeeper – from the Conservative Centre for Policy Studies</a> . Titled Costly and Ineffective, it's so radical and egalitarian that it caused the resignation of CPS board members, including Lord Forsyth, doyen of many a City investment bank and insurance company who was reportedly \"apoplectic\" at what he called a \"Stalinist\" policy. No surprise, for it proposes the demolition of the pensions industry.</p><p>The paper pulls the rug from under the rationale for most tax reliefs, exposing vast sums the Treasury could claw back. Relief on contributions, national insurance, tax-exempt lump sums and others amounts to a phenomenal £48.4bn a year. Half all tax relief goes to the top 8% earning over £50,000, who need no incentives. Just abolishing higher-rate relief would bring in £7bn.</p><p>The crucial point is that the young no longer trust pensions. Now defined benefits are dead, no one knows what they will get for locking away cash in high-charging funds until the age of 70: paying off university debt and buying a home come first. Pensions as we knew them are over: when interest rates rise, many now auto-enrolled may drop out. The industry claims tax relief is just tax deferred until retirement, but Johnson shows how only one in seven higher earners ever pays it back, as most pay only basic rate once retired. What's more, charges snatched by the industry amount to more than the tax relief. This is benefit dependency for the City.</p><p>Johnson proposes something more attractive and fairer to all. Pensions and ISAs should be rolled into one, allowing savers to withdraw money as they like. The Treasury would add £1 for every £1 saved, equal relief for all, but anyone taking out cash before retirement would lose the Treasury contribution. It would cost less than today's relief and make saving understandable and attractive, with transparency on charges. His conclusion is devastating: the pension system is \"hugely expensive\", \"ineffective\" and \"skewed towards the wealthy\"; failing to create a savings culture in the young is \"exacerbating the looming generational inequality\". Most tax relief is anyway \"captured by the industry.\"</p><p>Such radical reform would, says Johnson, \"require preparedness to confront deeply entrenched vested interests within the savings industry\". But the government has just failed that test, even on the modest first step of capping pension charges stolen from the \"hardworking\" to line City silk purses.</p><p>The pension bill now in parliament has no cap, or transparency on charges. On Monday Lord Lawson, putting forward amendments similar to Labour's, demanded compulsory disclosure and independent supervision, complaining that \"the foxes are regulating the hen coop\". Here was a former Tory chancellor – a Tory chancellor! – saying: \"There is absolutely no correlation between investment management fees and performance\" – adding that \"portfolios are being deliberately churned to generate commissions\". That's Ed Miliband's tune. Is anyone surprised this government has caved in?</p>","headline":"Steve Webb's pensions U-turn is a dead duck on the dust heap of disasters","trailText":"<p><strong>Polly Toynbee:</strong> The

At the end I was told that I owed £230 and I should pay £150 now,\" one reader said.</p><p></p><p>\"Like an idiot I did so, and then I realised I had not been filling in an Inland Revenue form but a form for one of these websites that purport to do a service for you, which you can do yourself.\"</p><p></p><p>Another reader emailed to say: \"It's quite clever really as 95% of the pages you view are official HMRC forms so when they ask you for the money at the end you're fairly well hypnotised into thinking it's for the Inland Revenue in advance of the tax bill.</p><p></p><p>\"If I know two (now three) people within 50 yards of me that have been affected, Lord knows how many there are across the country!\" He has since complained to the Advertising Standards Authority and to Google, \"but I suspect the response will be far too late for most people.\"</p><p></p><p>There are around 2.8m self-assessment forms still to be filed by the 31 January deadline, but HMRC said it could not close down the copycat sites or match the large amounts of money the sites pay to come top of searches.</p><p></p><p>An HMRC spokesman said: \"It costs nothing to file a tax return. Whilst people are entirely free to employ a tax return agent, HMRC does not sanction or in any way approve such sites, and we will take firm action against any websites that suggest otherwise.</p><p></p><p>\"People should steer clear of third-party websites unless they are clear about what they are getting themselves in to and what fees they are going to be charged.\"</p><p></p><p>The only address for Tax Return Gateway and its parent company, Who4 Ltd, is in Clerkenwell, London, but is simply a mail forwarding address. The website has no telephone number and only gives an \"info\" email address. The Guardian asked how many customers have used the site, why it was charging for a service that could be found for free, and if it would offer refunds, but we did not receive a reply.</p><p></p><p>The website appears to conform to Google's rules that require sites to tell viewers they are not the official site and that the service is available for free elsewhere. Below a large text banner that says \"Complete Your Self Assessment Tax Return Online\" and a button that pushes people to \"Submit your tax assessment online now\" there is an italicised message which says in smaller text: \"We are not connected to or affiliated with HMRC, DWP or any other official government body. We offer a bespoke, value for money, tax return assistance service for which we levy a charge.\"</p><p></p><p>Further down the page it also carries a \"Why use our services\" checklist, comparing itself to HMRC, and declares that it is a private company, not an official body. So why do so many people believe they are in the HMRC site?</p><p></p><p>A reader who contacted us on Thursday wrote: \"It's hard to believe that anyone who has followed the Saturday Consumer Champions column in the Guardian for years could do the foolish thing that I did yesterday. I submitted a self-assessment on the above website thinking throughout that I was on an HMRC short-cut site. There was no excuse for this, as I am used to the official website, but I think I was misled by 'Gateway', which is used by HMRC.\"</p><p></p><p>The reader said he had paid £500 on completing the form. \"On reflection, the wording was grossly misleading, indicating that the actual balance of tax due could be more or less than this amount … I am left with the uneasy feeling that this company has all my personal details, income sources etc. The final irony is that when I submitted my self-assessment form on the official site this morning, my tax underpayment was £2.20!\"</p><p></p><p>The value of the website's additional services as \"tax agents\" is unconvincing, say accountants. \"I don't see how they can check for errors if they don't know your situation,\" says Richard Mannion from accountants Smith &amp; Williamson. \"Anyway, filing your return can be very straightforward online and you don't need a tax agent.\"</p><p></p><p>In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: \"We have a strict set of policies which govern what types of ads appear on Google. If we learn that an advertiser is breaching those policies, we move swiftly to take action. We are working closely with Government Digital Services to ensure that ads are not misleading and offer real value.\"</p>","headline":"Self-assessment: taxpayers caught out by 'copycat'

Yet a new report says our most common password is still 123456. Is it laziness that makes us so careless or something else?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-23T00:05:22Z","body":"<p>Modern life demands of us a seemingly endless series of trivial choices, not the least of which is the requirement to&nbsp;make up a password for your hundred-and-somethingth web account. Who can be bothered to create&nbsp;and memorise yet another twisty bolus of alphanumeric gibberish? Not many of us, it seems. According to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10587694/Worst-password-of-2013-was-123456-according-to-new-research.html\" title=\"\">a new report</a> by Splashdata, the most common password in 2013 was \"123456\", closely followed by that faithful old standby, \"password\", which it is somehow charming to see still so popularly deployed. Is this sheer laziness, a lack of security education, or something else?</p><p>Some of the other popular passwords on Splashdata's list (mined mainly from a huge leak of Adobe customers' details) do begin to paint an intriguing portrait of the collective digital id. Isn't it heartwarming to see \"iloveyou\" at No 9? (Unless people are typing it to themselves, which would imply that extensive use of the internet really does turn you into a frothing narcissist.) At No 14 is \"letmein\", which one can't help hearing as containing an implied \"goddammit\" at&nbsp;the end. (It also reminds us that a&nbsp;\"password\" was originally spoken to&nbsp;gain admission to secure parts of a&nbsp;palace or military installation.) Somewhat surprisingly, No 17 is \"monkey\", whether out of general admiration for our simian cousins or a&nbsp;hitherto unsuspected upsurge in popularity of the seminal 1970s kung-fu show it is hard to tell.</p><p>At 24 on the list, presumably contributed by a lot of The X-Files fans,&nbsp;is \"trustno1\". But this seems a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;contradictory. If you really were a&nbsp;paranoid sci-fi enthusiast who believed that the government was run&nbsp;by aliens, wouldn't you choose a&nbsp;stronger password? On the other hand, if it is government snooping in&nbsp;particular that you care about, you&nbsp;will suspect that passwords are irrelevant, since we now know the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\" title=\"\">NSA&nbsp;and GCHQ</a> can hack into just about anything.</p><p>But spies aren't the only ones looking; there are also cyber-gangs mounting sophisticated attacks on websites in order to hoover up ID details, credit-card information, and so on. Why make it easy for them? <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tomstafford\" title=\"\">Tom Stafford</a>, lecturer in psychology and cognitive science at the University of Sheffield, says: \"Most people seem to believe there is little risk in having weak passwords – most of us seem to&nbsp;rely on 'security by obscurity'. Obviously this isn't a wise choice as more and more of our lives are online.\"</p><p>It has long been known, moreover, that even when people are encouraged to choose a password stronger than \"123456\" or \"admin\", they tend to fall into predictable patterns. According to <a href=\"http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/81/Passwords.asp\" title=\"\">a 2006 study by Shannon Riley</a> of the psychology of password generation, \"users typically use birthdates, anniversary dates, telephone numbers, licence plate numbers, social security numbers, street addresses, apartment numbers, etc. Likewise, personally meaningful words are typically derived from predictable areas and interests in&nbsp;the person's life and could be guessed through basic knowledge of his or her interests.\" Hence all the TV detectives who guess brilliantly that the suspect's laptop password is the name of her dog.</p><p>We should hesitate to interpret these findings as showing that ordinary internet users are just stupid, however. The firm that compiled this list, Splashdata, sells password-management software, so it is understandable that the lesson it derives from its findings is&nbsp;that people should choose stronger passwords, perhaps with the benign help of its own products. So why don't&nbsp;they?</p><p>One reason might be that, since we&nbsp;all think that some of our accounts (for example, banking, Facebook) are more important than others (a Tumblr that sends you a picture of a kitten every morning), we believe it doesn't matter if we&nbsp;use weak passwords for the latter. But this is risky since it means those services become a big target for hackers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/adobe-password-leak-can-check\" title=\"\">as Adobe's did</a>. Indeed, the rise of two-factor authentication – where you need both&nbsp;a password and a unique code generated by your smartphone to log in&nbsp;– is beginning to ease the password problem for services people really care about, such as email or Dropbox. So it is those \"disposable\" accounts that are really the dangerous ones. This is all the more galling when one considers that, according to <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/desktop/passwords-value-lie-in-psychology-not-security-/d/d-id/1089797?\" title=\"\">a 2010 study by Joseph Bonneau and Sören Preibusch</a>, many websites use passwords \"primarily for psychological reasons, both as a justification for collecting marketing data, and as a way to build trusted relationships with customers\" – in other words, the password demand is a commercially motivated placebo to begin with.</p><p>The second reason people might be driven to choose such weak passwords when they can get away with it is because technology's way of attempting to save us from ourselves is so irritating. You know the drill on some websites: your password must be between eight and 12 characters long, and contain a mixture of upper-case and lower-case letters, as well as numbers, punctuation marks, currency symbols, sad-faced emoji and the Chinese characters for \"For heaven's sake, will this do?\". It is unlikely you&nbsp;will remember one of those, let alone&nbsp;dozens.</p><p>Stafford says: \"For me, passwords are a great example of how technology asks us to be more like computers rather than computers learning to be more like us. Recommended passwords are strings of arbitrary letters, numbers and strings – exactly the thing it is easy for computers to store, and difficult for&nbsp;humans. It's the reserve of the early&nbsp;dreams of artificial intelligence, asking our intelligence to be more like the artificial.\"</p><p>As it happens, it is also simply bad security. In point of mathematical fact,&nbsp;a picturesque phrase such as \"lemon Beyoncé anvil cake\" is far more difficult to crack than \"j&amp;!Wo078:(((\", because every extra character of password length expands the combinatorial possibilities in dizzying fashion. This is well known to fans of&nbsp;the web-comic <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/936/\" title=\"\">XKCD</a>, which has explained why a brute-force attempt to&nbsp;hack the password \"correct horse battery staple\" would take a fast computer 550 years. (The geek joke is&nbsp;that, since that cartoon appeared, everyone's password is now \"correct horse battery staple\".)</p><p>The wholesale replacement of text passwords by reliable biometrics (such as fingerprint scanners) is one of those technological promises that has been around for decades and still has not come to fruition, despite the fingerprint sensor on the new iPhone. In the meantime, I like to think of the millions of people choosing \"password\" for their password as a kind of silent dissident movement, a virtual groundswell of sardonic protest at the manifold laborious annoyances of digital existence.</p><p>If you doubt that a simple password can be sarcastic, consider number 25 on the most-popular list, \"000000\", which has a curious historical analogue. In the late 1970s, according to Eric Schlosser's recent book about nuclear security, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/25/command-control-eric-schlosser-review\" title=\"\">Command and Control</a>, it was&nbsp;decided that the US air force's Minuteman nuclear missiles should all be fitted with a device requiring a code to be entered before they could be launched. In what Schlosser calls an \"act of defiance\" against prissy safety concerns, the USAF set the password to \"00000000\" everywhere. I don't know about you, but that puts the possibility of my Twitter account being hacked into some sort of perspective.</p>","headline":"Your password is easy to crack","trailText":"We all know cyber-gangs are out there attacking websites, hoping to raid our bank accounts and credit cards.

In some cases, payments for the policies reduced workers' pay to below the minimum wage.</p><p></p><p>Responding in the House of Commons, the business secretary, Vince Cable, said the practice was indefensible and possibly illegal, and said the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) would investigate the companies. He did not rule out a broader inquiry into the practice.</p><p></p><p>Umunna said he had evidence that Blue Arrow, Staffline, Acorn, Taskmaster, Randstad and Meridian were all involved in selling personal accident insurance to workers at a profit. Between them they employee more than 100,000 people in jobs around the UK.</p><p></p><p>He told MPs: \"There is even a company, G7 Group, which specialises in putting together these dubious arrangements for agencies. Further to my questions on this topic from October last year, will [government] now commit to holding a full inquiry into this shabby practice?\"</p><p></p><p>Cable said the government would make sure \"we have proper enforcement procedure. You have listed more companies today, we will investigate them and it may well merit a more broadly based inquiry\".</p><p></p><p>He added that the employment agency standards inspectorate was investigating the individual cases. \"We will take enforcement action and if it proves to be a widespread practice then clearly there is a case for a more broadly based inquiry,\" Cable said.</p><p></p><p>The Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation (REC), the trade body for the recruitment industry, said profiteering was \"a very serious allegation\" and asked Umunna to share any specific evidence he had to support the accusations.</p><p></p><p>Tom Hadley, director of policy and professional services at the REC, said: \"Let's be clear, employment agencies are not doing anything wrong by offering workers the opportunity to purchase accident insurance. It is a product that many other organisations offer to their members, including trade unions.</p><p></p><p>\"Personal accident cover can be appropriate for workers in high-risk sectors such as rail and construction, and may also cover them for accidents off-site that would prevent them from working, and provides them with an income whilst off work. By offering these benefits employment agencies are giving temporary workers the same kind of support as that enjoyed by permanent contracted employees.\"</p><p></p><p>But he said the REC had a code of conduct which required agencies to be open and transparent with workers. \"Anyone concerned can contact us, and we have a robust complaints process for handling agency workers' concerns and ensuring agencies are compliant with both the law and best practice.\"</p><p>In a statement, Blue Arrow said it took the welfare of employees very seriously, and that it did not believe anyone had taken out the insurance without fully understanding the benefits and the cost.</p><p></p><p>\"Many [workers] are employed in industrial situations where accidents can happen. We therefore believe that employees should be offered the opportunity to take out personal accident insurance.</p><p></p><p>\"It is important to stress that this insurance is offered, not sold. Our consultants are fully trained and regulated in line with the Financial Conduct Authority's guidelines and are not paid commission as personal accident insurance is not a sales initiative.\"</p>","headline":"Recruitment firms face mis-selling claims over workers' insurance","trailText":"Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, says several agencies sold personal accident policies to workers already covered by their employers' insurance","newspaperPageNumber":"26","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5t5","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390483391685/Network-Rail-workers-fixi-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390483391685/Network-Rail-workers-fixi-006.jpg","wordcount":"542","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427843652","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8596720","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Hilary Osborne","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031485","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T13:25:02Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/23/recruitment-firms-mis-selling-claims-workers-insurance","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jan/23/recruitment-firms-mis-selling-claims-workers-insurance","tags":[{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers","references":[]},{"id":"money/employeebenefits","webTitle":"Employee benefits","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/employeebenefits","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/employeebenefits","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hilaryosborne","webTitle":"Hilary Osborne","r2ContributorId":"19188","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389368165211/Hilary-Osborne-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Hilary Osborne is the editor of guardian.co.uk's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\">money</a> site.

The lucky householder whose tracker mortgage follows base rate plus 1% would see the cost of a £150,000 interest-only mortgage soar from £188 a month to £500 a month if base rates rose to 3%, and to £750 a month if it hit 5%.</p><p>Households with repayment mortgages saw their bills fall less during the financial crisis and would in turn see less of a painful increase. Someone with a £150,000 repayment mortgage currently on a tracker rate of 2.5% would see their costs rise from £673 a month to £877 a month if rates went up to 3%, and to £1,060 if they hit 5%.</p><p>The house price boom in London and many parts of the south will swiftly go into reverse if rates rise – although for now most economists are projecting increases of 5% or more in 2014. But Phil Lachowycz of Fathom Financial Consulting, which has warned about the implications of rate rises, said: \"We think there is a housing bubble not just in London but across the country, yet the government is still encouraging people to take on debt through schemes such as Help to Buy. Households are still very indebted and we don't need much of a rate rise to tip the housing market into reverse.\"</p><p>Lachowycz expects a rise in inflation later this year, caused by the economy hitting capacity constraints, to put intense pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates.</p><p>Arrears and repossessions were the dog that didn't bark during the financial crisis, with households rescued by falling interest costs. Although the numbers in arrears rose between 2007 to 2009, they have fallen since and remain a fraction of the levels witnessed during the housing crash of the early 1990s.</p><p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said arrears fell in 2013, with just 149,000 households (1.33% of the total) in arrears worth 2.5% of their mortgage or more, compared with more than 400,000 in 1995. It also recently revised downwards its projection for repossessions in 2014 to below 37,000 homes.</p><p>Lenders have praised early action by the Labour government in 2008, which launched a mortgage rescue scheme to avert a sudden rise in repossessions, but are concerned about the impact of its removal in March.</p><p>The director general of the CML, Paul Smee, said: \"As the government's mortgage rescue scheme in the English regions closes to applications at the end of March, we will be sorry to see it go. While the 5,000 households helped directly through mortgage rescue may seem relatively small, the benefit to those households was huge.\"</p><p>But it may not take a rise in the Bank of England base rate for mortgage rates to start moving up, and with the Funding for Lending scheme being redirected to small businesses, mortgage deals are expected to become less attractive. Recent months have seen a rush of applicants for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages, with five-year deals available at rates of under 3% for buyers or remortgagers with lots of equity in their home. The CML said a record nine out of 10 borrowers were opting for a fixed-rate deal rather than a tracker mortgage that would rise in line with Bank of England rate increases.</p><p>Not everyone is upset about the prospect of rate rises, especially the millions of older people who rely on their bank and building society deposits to supplement their income.</p><p>A spokesman for the independent action group Save Our Savers, Simon Rose, said: \"Savers and pensioners would be delighted if interest rates were to rise in the near future. Many of them depend on their savings for their ability to survive, and they have been incredibly hard hit. But I think the Bank of England will delay putting up interest rates for as long as possible, and in the end we think they will be forced to raise them because the economy is growing too strongly.\"</p><p>• Watch our latest money videos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/smart-money\" title=\"\">here.</a></p><h2>What the experts say:</h2><h2>TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady:</h2><p>An early interest rate rise would clobber mortgage holders and businesses – jeopardising our economic recovery. Patchy levels of jobs growth in parts of the north and the continuing squeeze on living standards should make the Bank of England think twice before considering a rate raise.</p><h2>Phil Lachowycz of Fathom Financial Consulting:</h2><p>Households are still very indebted, and we don't need much of a rate rise to tip the housing market into reverse.</p><h2>Andrew Smith, Chief Economist at KPMG:</h2><p>Given that inflation has finally come down to target and that the economic recovery is still in its early stages, it would be perverse to do [raise rates] and as unemployment falls through 7%, the committee is more likely to change its guidance than raise interest rates.</p><h2>Andy Scott, currency dealers HiFX:</h2><p>Expectations of a hike next year will continue to make sterling look attractive, particularly against the euro, which could still see monetary policy eased due to very low inflation.</p><h2>Simon Rose, a spokesman for Save Our Savers, an independent action group: </h2><p>Savers and pensioners would be delighted if interest rates were to rise in the near future. Many of them depend on their savings for their ability to survive, and they have been incredibly hard hit.

There was nothing open back then. Monday to Thursday, all of society went to bed at midnight. Even the television shut down. In those days you worked shifts on a four-week cycle. In the space of five days, your whole system and body clock was completely the wrong way round. I've had doctors say you shouldn't eat at night, but I always took some sandwiches in or stopped by the kebab shop or the local fried chicken place.</p><p>It is physically demanding to try to&nbsp;stay awake all night. You are tired during the day and tired during the night. As I got older, I found it even more difficult to stay awake. By the time you get to the Monday, you're a zombie. You forget appointments, you have to write everything down. The quieter nights were harder.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720863'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390326495763/Graham-Wettone-008.jpg' alt='Graham Wettone' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graham Wettone: 'The biggest problem was digestive – I had loads of stomach upsets.'</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, you don't get a chance to sleep during the day. The rest of society doesn't expect you to sleep. In summer, everyone's out in the garden, cutting grass; you've got the curtains pulled and the earplugs in.</p><p>On the flip side, I loved night duty. The station was ours; no hustle and bustle in the workplace. You could get things done. But I packed it in because it was having an impact on my health. The biggest problem was digestive – I had loads of stomach upsets. It wasn't so much the heart problems or breathlessness the report mentions: I got checked for that, along with other colleagues. After 15 years of working nights, it was a bit of a relief when I stopped. I could almost feel my system saying: \"Thank God that's over, it's back to normal now.\" <strong>PC</strong></p><h2><strong>Kathryn McLaughlin, 30</strong><br /><strong>Burlesque dancer and fire performer</strong><br /></h2><p>I have been working nights for about 10&nbsp;years. The week gets later as it goes on. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, I get to bed about 5am. I have never found it hard to stay awake. When I&nbsp;was little, my mum used to take me to&nbsp;the doctors because I would be up all&nbsp;night reading. I have always been a&nbsp;night owl. Even if I'm not working I&nbsp;wouldn't go to sleep until about 3&nbsp;or&nbsp;4am. I find it easier to do things that require more thought later at&nbsp;night.</p><p>I suspect some of the health effects tie in with the fact that, when you get&nbsp;in late, you are not inclined to sit down and make a proper dinner. I&nbsp;think it's more about making choices to eat something sensible instead of just grabbing something on the go. I&nbsp;have my evening meal between 10.30&nbsp;and 11pm. I go to the gym five times a week.</p><p>For me, this is actually a better way of living: I'm not somebody who functions well at 8 or 9am. When I had a job with more normal hours, I was always drinking Red Bull or eating cheese toasties on my way to work to reward myself for having got up. <strong>PC</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720864'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390326028586/Dr-Zakia-Akhteruzzaman-008.jpg' alt='Dr Zakia Akhteruzzaman' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dr Zakia Akhteruzzaman: 'The most ­difficult thing is no fixed times … it's difficult to have a social life.'</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Dr Zakia Akhteruzzaman, 32</strong><br /><strong>General practitioner </strong><br /></h2><p>\"I worked night shifts on and off for three years when I was a junior doctor, but the worst time was four long months in A&amp;E. It was disorientating. A&amp;E totally messes up your body clock. You have long shifts – 12 or 13 hours – and you have no time to process anything. There's no window in the main emergency room, so you don't know what's happening outside. I felt totally out of touch with the universe. The most difficult thing is that there's no fixed times. One day you do 8am to 5pm and then 8pm to 8am for a few days, and then sometimes till 2am. So every day is different. It's difficult to have a social life, and your body can't adjust.</p><p>You feel very unwell and jetlagged. I&nbsp;could barely talk sometimes. I would be seeing a patient and taking down their history, and then would have to go to the toilet and cough up phlegm. Twice when I was on night shift I had to take time off as I was sick in bed. I&nbsp;remember feeling really guilty.</p><p>When we qualified, there were some doctors who wanted to do A&amp;E, mainly because they enjoyed acute medicine and the associated adrenaline rush, but it wasn't for me. I don't see how you could have any work/life balance and work those shifts.</p><p>But as difficult as it was, I also remember it with some nostalgia. It&nbsp;sounds strange, but hospitals can be peaceful at that time. During the day, the patients are in the corridor and there are doctors huddling. But at night, it's often just you walking along the corridors. We would have really deep conversations at that time – even discussing spirituality and deeper issues. I&nbsp;have never found that during the day. I think people feel a bit more vulnerable and open up more. Also, another positive thing is that at this time you really get a chance to bond. Sometimes the junior handles the shop floor while the senior is asleep or does some paperwork, and so the motherly nurses – especially on paediatrics – would look out for juniors and would make a bed and say: \"It's quiet now, get some sleep.\" <strong>AG</strong></p><h2><strong>Lucy Horsfall, 34</strong><br /><strong>Senior cabin crew</strong><br /></h2><p>I have been doing this for 11 years. It's my job, and you just fight through it. The challenge is going through time zones. Coming back from Los Angeles, it's dark and then you see the dawn rising through the clouds – and in the cockpit they say we haven't even got to New York. I tell myself it's still night, keep the window blinds down. I think that's the only way I can deal with it.</p><p>My airline is very good. It gives us the correct rest. You get allotted a break time on the long flights and you have a bunk you can sleep in. The minimum rest is three hours. That really helps – you can actually fall asleep. The hardest part is at about 2.30 or 3am, when you start getting really cold. That's when I get most tired. It's a really heady feeling when we land in the morning. But an hour or two later you get a real crash and start to feel sick. Diet-wise, it can be tricky. You're craving sugar through the evening, eating chocolate or whatever's around. You're eating dinner at 3am just to get a sugar hit.</p><p>I suppose you could get depressed if you worked on your own through the night. You could start thinking about things. But I have got a team around me. We'll have a chat, a cup of coffee, and if one person's tired we'll go and do something like cleaning: it's just a little thing, but it takes your mind off it.</p><p>I've never had anything wrong with me, other than tiredness and jetlag. When I come back from maternity leave I'll still be doing night shifts, but I'll be part-time – two or three long-haul flights a month. <strong>PC</strong></p><h2><strong>Alex Lester, 57</strong><br /><strong>BBC Radio 2 DJ</strong><br /></h2><p>I've been doing night shifts for 26 years and I'm still alive, so hopefully it's all right. It just turns your day on its head, that's all.</p><p>The downsides are mainly social. I&nbsp;play a lot of music, and I'm always looking out for new stuff, so I get invited to a lot of concerts, and I have to say: \"I'm sorry, but unless it's a Beatles reunion with all the original members I won't be able to make it.\" They say: \"The band are on stage at 9.30.\" And I go: \"Er, I'll have been in bed for two hours.\"</p><p>There are upsides, though. I don't get stuck in the rush hour. I don't get stuck in crowds, so during the day I can do things while everyone's at work. My&nbsp;Christmas shopping is usually done&nbsp;before everybody else's.</p><p>During the first few months I had a&nbsp;bit of trouble sleeping. There's this figure eight hours that's been plucked from somewhere, and when I started working nights I would go to bed thinking, \"I must get my eight hours!\", and then lie awake all night worrying about getting the amount of sleep I needed. People worry far too much about that, but your body will tell you how much you need.</p><p>Once you are doing night shifts on a permanent basis, your body clock sort of adjusts. So I'm now a nocturnal creature. I tend to go to bed at 7.30 in the evening and then get up at one in the morning and go to work. Then I'm back in bed again by about six in the morning and tend to be asleep until 10&nbsp;or 10.30am. That's the way my body clock works. I'm hoping that it won't have any long-term health effects. I'd have thought I would have noticed it by now if it did. <strong>TM</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390326685205/Simon-Matthews-008.jpg' alt='Simon Matthews' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Simon Matthews: 'There’s a different atmosphere at night; it’s nicer.'</figcaption></figure><h2>Simon Matthews, 48<br />Freelance lorry driver<br /></h2><p>Night working is a damn sight easier than day work. At night, there's far less traffic on the road, especially in the summer. There is something peaceful about it: you're totally on your own, with nice open road most of the time. Serenity is a good word. There's a different atmosphere at night; it's nicer. People aren't so stressed. Probably because the rest of the world is sleeping.</p><p>I don't do many nights any more because I'm semi-retired, but I never really had a problem staying awake. Your body clock seems to be set so that it wants to shut down around 2.30 or 3 in the morning. Your body temperature goes down, but I don't really ever seem to want to go to sleep.</p><p>The longest stint of night shifts I have done, without day shifts between, was eight weeks. I was carrying chilled food products. It was a similar journey every night, from Taunton up to Oxford, down to Southampton and then back to Taunton. I felt as if I was permanently in a different time zone. It affects your head. You feel totally out of sorts coming off nights and then having to live a day life for two days, and then going back on to nights again. I imagine it would have very detrimental effects on you, especially mentally <strong>PC</strong></p><h2>Torgeir Fotland, 33 <br />Former psychiatric nursing assistant<br /></h2><p>I did this temping job in Oslo in 2010 and 2011. There were three of us working from 10pm to 8am, making sure that patients were asleep and taking care of them if they needed to get up. We were just waiting there in case something happened. That made it harder to stay awake. The others brought in their computers or were in front of the TV or reading. They had some sort of activity which occupied them privately. I was a bit miffed, thinking: just sitting here looking at a wall, I might fall asleep in five minutes. I was working with guys who had done it for decades. They had their routine. I spent a lot of time on YouTube – I don't know how people survived this job before the internet.</p><p>You're fine until midnight, even sociable. Two comes, three. And then you become cold. You'd be sitting there at 4am, saying: \"This is not good for the health is it?\" \"No, definitely not.\" \"How long are you intending to do it?\" \"A while. Better pay.\"</p><p>For me, it was a temporary thing. But looking at my colleagues, the regular staff, they had a routine. They had done it for 20 or 30 years. I don't think that can be good. You miss out on life; you don't really see people; you are on the outside of society. I'm on the same bus as everyone else, but they're going to work and I'm going home. They look fresh and I look like I just killed someone. I couldn't do it for long without thinking: what's going on out there in the world? <strong>PC</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427720866'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390330109635/Dan-Doherty-011.jpg' alt='Dan Doherty' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dan Doherty: 'The atmosphere in a 24-hour restaurant can be … interesting.'</figcaption></figure><h2>Zdenek Honsa, 35<br />Engineer<br /></h2><p>I have just changed jobs so as not to work nights. For 18 months I worked as an engineer on the London Eye – mostly maintenance, fixing things that had broken during the day. I worked a 12-hour shift, 8pm to 8am. I didn't find it hard to stay awake, but it used to take a week to get back to normal. It doesn't surprise me that there may be long-term health effects. I hope I didn't do it for long enough to matter. I felt very tired. If I got five hours' sleep that would be really good. Sometimes it would be four or less, and often not in one go. I also noticed that my digestion went quite funny.</p><p>It was nice to get to see the city at night though. It was quite special on the London Eye. Even the commuting was quite nice in the dark. Going over Waterloo Bridge was lovely. And I could see my son during the day more. If I had a choice, I wouldn't do nights again. But sometimes you can't pick jobs. <strong>PC</strong></p><h2>Dan Doherty, 29<br />Executive chef at Duck and Waffle 24-hour restaurant<br /></h2><p>It's surreal, that's the only way I can describe it. Working an eight-hour shift from 10pm to 6am is so much more different from eight hours in the day. I do both throughout the week – post-midnight dining is an integral part of our business – and so my body is in a permanent state of jetlag. At 2am, you get more celebrities; footballers on one table, Made in Chelsea on another. There's also travellers on different time zones and couples on dates. It's always strange because all the signals that normally dictate you leaving a restaurant – catching the last tube, the waiters clearing up – don't apply and the atmosphere can be … interesting.</p><p>I do like it, but if you don't plan it properly, not seeing sunlight can have an adverse affect on your personality – it's not normal, is it? It goes against everything our bodies do. I'm more spaced out. You eat too much, the same way you do when you travel, and it can make you feel gross. You're constantly dull-eyed and because I mix it up and it's not routine, my sleeping patterns are entirely random. My wife works normal hours and I try to cook when I get in so we can at least have breakfast together but even that's hard – I want sausages and mash after a night shift ends at 6am, not eggs or pastries.</p><p>The upside? Sunrise is the most beautiful time to drive through London. <strong>NI</strong></p><h2>Peter Collins, 33<br />Spacecraft engineer <br /></h2><p>I work as part of what we call the flight control team at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt in Germany. I'm currently working on a mission called Gaia, which is a star mapper. It was launched in December and is travelling to a point which is 1.5m km from the Earth in the opposite direction to the sun. From there, it will map our galaxy, the Milky Way.</p><p>My particular area is the power and thermal systems on Gaia. I have to make sure the spacecraft's got enough power; that the solar array is working as it should; the distribution of the power through the spacecraft's working; and, on the thermal side, that everything is in the right thermal ranges.</p><p>In the first few months after the mission has launched it's quite intense. The first few days are critical. Once we've launched, for the week following the launch, we're in 12-hour shifts. So you're often working through the night. For those four or five days you basically just eat, sleep and work. You get into just working and not really knowing what time of day it is.</p><p>It's totally worth it for me, but then I don't have to do it for years and years and years. We have what are called spacecraft controllers, who come in when the mission is up and running. They have to be there the whole time to make sure the spacecraft is working. They're on their own in the control room overnight, day in, day out, night in, night out, which must be tough. It's not something I could do, because of the loneliness. Personally, I think it's being on your own for the whole time that would have an effect on your health; it's losing touch a bit of what's going on around you because you're so focused on work.</p><p>In my case, I don't think working nights has had a lasting effect on my health, but during the period that I'm doing it I would say my home life was affected, in that all I was doing was going home to eat, sleep, get up and go back to work again. My wife does a similar job, elsewhere at ESOC. It will be the same for her in a couple of years when her mission launches, but we both understand that it's only a short-term thing. <strong>TM</strong></p>","headline":"Is working night shifts bad for you?","trailText":"<p>A new study claims that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25812422\" title=\"\">working nights can disrupt gene activity</a> after only three days – and the health dangers are thought to include an increased risk of breast cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart attacks.

Between April and June 2008, 13% of the economically active population aged 18-24 was unemployed, a figure that had increased to 19% by the same period of 2013.</p><p>The percentage of unemployed people who live with their parents (13%) is more than twice that (6%) of those who live independently.</p><p>The increase in the number of young adults living with parents also coincides with a period in which house prices rose relative to incomes. In 1996, the typical first-time buyer had to raise 2.7 times their salary to afford to buy a home, but by 2013 the figure stood at 4.47. This, combined with stricter mortgage criteria and rising private rents, is likely to have driven more young adults back to the family home.</p><p>Matthew Pointon, housing economist at Capital Economics, said it was no surprise the increase had coincided with the economic downturn.</p><p>\"The recession hit the young particularly hard, with a sharp rise in youth unemployment. Furthermore, there was a collapse in the availability of mortgages for buyers with small deposits, which prevented many would-be first-time buyers from flying the nest,\" he said. </p><p>\"With lenders demanding a deposit of at least 25%, and with savings rates at record lows, many young buyers desperate to get on the housing ladder would have seen staying with their parents a little longer to boost their savings as their only option.\"</p><p>Matt Griffith, an associate fellow at the IPPR thinktank who has written on housing policy, said the figures highlighted a political failure in dealing with housing. \"Short-term recession-related unemployment is colliding with long-term housing failure to create intense pressures on young people and their housing choices. We are seeing a regression towards much less mobile households as a result,\" he said.  </p><p>\"Unfortunately, up until now, the policies we need to address this – much greater levels of housebuilding and reining in excessive housing demand – are seen as upsetting that more powerful generational political force: older voters. The silver lining is that housing costs are now so absurd we are starting to see a recognition across all groups that things really do need to change.\"</p><p>Neil Hudson, associate director of residential research at estate agency Savills, said the housing market was already working against young people before the downturn began. \"First-time buyer numbers started to drop-off in 2003 suggesting that by that point the market was beginning to get a bit too expensive for many younger people; it was at that time that the buy-to-let sector really began to rise too,\" he said. \"We also saw younger people starting to come out of university with more student debt.\" Hudson said parents who were able to put up their adult children were acting as a \"pressure valve\" on the rental sector, where the average cost of housing is more than £800 a month. \"People can think 'I may lose a bit of my social life but I will save a lot of money if I move back in with my parents',\" he said.</p><p>The ONS said that in 1996, the typical first-time buyer had to raise 2.7 times their salary to afford to buy a home, but by 2013 the figure stood at 4.47.  </p><p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said the figures wouldn't be a surprise \"to the thousands of hard-working young people still living in their childhood bedroom\". He added: \"The government already knows that it needs to meet people halfway and give hard-working young people the chance to put down roots in a stable home of their own. Now it has to get serious about the chronic shortage of affordable homes and make building a priority, rather than pumping more taxpayers' money into mortgage guarantee schemes.\"</p><p>Christine Northam, a counsellor at the advice charity Relate, said the change was also putting pressure on parents who had expected their children to move out when they went into higher education. \"It's a role change, people may have to learn to cope with living with an adult child. If the couple aren't very good at adapting it can be difficult,\" she said. \"Couples who had held on for the sake of the children find that they are holding on for longer.\"</p><p>A breakdown of the figures along gender lines showed that for every 10 women aged 20-34 who lived with their parents in 2013, 17 men did so. The ONS said this substantial difference could be explained by looking at the living situations of young adults.</p><p>\"In the 20-34 age group, over 600,000 more women than men were living as part of a couple in their own household,\" it said. \"The main reason for this is that, on average, women form partnerships with men older than themselves. Thus more women than men in this age group were married or cohabiting.\"</p><p>In addition, 589,000 more women than men were lone parents in their own household, and women were more likely to take part in higher education than men, leving the family home to do so.</p><p>The ONS also compared UK data with figures from Europe, and said that in many EU countries young adults were more likely to live with their parents.</p><p>In the UK, 15% of 25- to 34-year-olds are in the family home, and the proprtion is lower in just six of the 28 countries of the European Union. In Denmark the figure was just 2%, but in Croatia it reached 68%.</p><h2>Case study</h2><p>Katrina Parmiter, 26, and her fiance Harry Orford, 25, moved in with his mother, Maxine, and two younger sisters last August after living together in a rented home. Their plan was to save up for their wedding this July and for a home. </p><p>It has not gone quite as they hoped, says Katrina: \"Sadly, a good portion of our income seems to go on outings and activities to keep us out of the house. It's not as though we don't all get along – they are fabulous and so welcoming – but the adjustment from our own space to someone else's has been more difficult than anticipated.\" </p><p>Katrina, an accountant, says it has been hard to get used to using someone else's things after time in her own home, and that she feels much more obliged to wash up quickly and be tidy. \"Basically, I miss the opportunity to be lazy,\" she says. </p><p>The couple pay rent and contribute to food bills, and have put their furniture in storage, so they are still a way off raising the money to buy in Bridport, Dorset, which has been dubbed \"Notting Hill on Sea\" because of its popularity with London buyers. </p><p>\"Not a lot of property comes on the market here for under £200,000,\" says Katrina. \"There are a lot of people who I went to sixth form with who just can't afford to live here.\" She and Harry have decided that once they are married they will move into rented accommodation again. The couple were spending £525 a month renting a home in the town but when the tenancy came up they decided to approach Harry's mum and ask if they could move in. Harry says it was a culture shock after almost four years away from the family home. As well as living with his mum, he  works with her but he says she is \"quite good at giving us our own space\".</p><p>Maxine is thrilled to have all of her children back at home. \"I love it,\" she says. \"I think it's a great compliment that they wanted to come back – they could have found an alternative. I enjoy having them around the house.\"</p><p>She says she has not set any house rules. \"I did all that when they were growing up. They know how to behave.\" </p><p>Despite her enthusiasm, Maxine admits there will be benefits when her children do leave home again: \"I shall miss them but it will be nice to get some space back.\"</p>","headline":"Record levels of young adults living at home, says ONS","trailText":"<p>Stricter mortgage criteria and rising rents, coupled with higher unemployment, means more young adults are staying in the family home, official figures show</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m3ed","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390306416883/A-young-female-woman-in-h-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390306416883/A-young-female-woman-in-h-006.jpg","wordcount":"1490","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427617352","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8581136","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Hilary Osborne","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-22T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2029927","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-24T11:07:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/21/record-levels-young-adults-living-home-ons","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jan/21/record-levels-young-adults-living-home-ons","tags":[{"id":"money/family-finances","webTitle":"Family finances","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/family-finances","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/family-finances","references":[]},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers","references":[]},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/property","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"society/unemployment","webTitle":"Unemployment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/unemployment","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"society/youngpeople","webTitle":"Young people","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/youngpeople","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/youngpeople","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"uk/office-for-national-statistics","webTitle":"Office for National Statistics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hilaryosborne","webTitle":"Hilary Osborne","r2ContributorId":"19188","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389368165211/Hilary-Osborne-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Hilary Osborne is the editor of guardian.co.uk's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money\">money</a> site.

It refused to make the change until the electricity ran out, which left us without power for 14 hours and then the meter was replaced by another prepay meter. </strong></p><p><strong>When, finally, a credit meter was installed we began to receive excessively high bills. It transpired that Npower had placed us on its highest tariff and it later admitted a mistake. It promised to recalculate our accounts and issue us with a new bill. This was never done. </strong></p><p><strong>We therefore cancelled our direct debit as we had lost confidence in Npower's accounting procedures. We accept that we owe money, but we are unable to accept or trust its assessment of our outstanding debt, when it seems clear that at least on one occasion they have included, as debt, monies already paid by us.  </strong><em>AA, Southampton</em></p><p></p><p>Npower claims that you originally requested that a faulty prepayment metre was replaced and that it only became aware you wanted to be moved to credit metering when the technician arrived at your house. Then it says that since your new account was being processed, it couldn't install the credit meter for another four weeks.</p><p>Bizarrely, it says that after it was installed you were kept on the standard tariff that is the only available option for prepayment customers because you hadn't specifically asked to be on the best tariff. Regardless of whether you did, or not, it's depressing, but unsurprising, that companies don't automatically notify customers they are paying too much.</p><p>After the intervention of the press office Npower has refunded the £339 difference between the standard tariff you were paying and the best one,  plus £50 compensation, but you are still wary of their calculations.</p><p>It's the energy ombudsman who will have to decide who is right.</p><p></p><p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at  </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy's own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?</p><p></p><p><strong>I have a colleague who constantly distracts me. It is not that he talks to me specifically or particularly loudly, but he constantly sings, puts on babyish voices and mutters under his breath. One really annoying habit is repeating what other people say in a stupid voice: one person may say \"That was a difficult phone call\" and he will mimic them and say \"Difficult oooh yeah!\". Or a colleague on the phone might say \"Goodbye\" and he will put on a stupid voice and say \"Goodbye\" as well. It is constant. When he sings, it is usually the chorus of the same song over and over again for weeks.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I have taken him to one side and tactfully said, \"I'm not sure if you realise, but you tend to sing and talk under your breath quite often. A few people have said they find it distracting\". His behaviour stopped for an afternoon but started again the next day. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I have asked my manager to move desks and this may happen in a few months, but I will have to deal with this man in the meantime. Also, if I move someone else will have to put up with him, which seems unfair. A lot of other people have complained about him but my manager just shrugs and says \"There is not much I can do about it\".</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>When it gets particularly loud I have mentioned that I really need to focus, but I get a stupid comment in a stupid voice such as \"You are a woman, you should be able to multi-task\". This man is in his 40s.</strong></p><p></p><p>Do you need advice on a work issue?

We bought it in November 2010 for £230,000 with a mortgage of £185,000 and a deposit of £35,000. There is a deed of trust for the money put in – £25,000 goes back to me or my mother as she gave me that much to put down as a deposit. As both my partner and I each put £5,000 in cash towards the deposit, the rest is split 50/50.</p><p></p><p>The flat, which is in Brixton, has gone up in value with estate agents estimating an asking price of anywhere up to £350,000 (although realistically the actual purchase price would be more like £320,000 to £330,000). What kind of offer would it be fair for me to make to buy my ex-partner out?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>To take on the mortgage I would have to reduce it as well, as I can only borrow up to £165,000 based on my self-employed status and variable income (I wasn't self-employed when we bought the property). Any help and advice of what would be fair, and regarding stamp duty implications, would be very helpful. <strong>NS</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong> To be able to buy out your ex-partner, you need to take on his share of the mortgage and pay him cash for his half of the value of the flat that you agree on, less the size of the mortgage at the time you took it on and less the £25,000 your mother gave you towards the deposit.</p><p></p><p>Assuming you have a 25-year repayment mortgage and have been paying interest at 5% for the past three years, that would mean taking on an outstanding mortgage of approximately £173,000 (as about £12,000 of the original £185,000 would have been paid off over three years). I'm afraid the only way of reducing the mortgage to £165,000 is to overpay it. Your lender won't just reduce the loan to suit your change in circumstances.</p><p></p><p>If you were to buy out your ex using an asking price of £330,000 for the flat, as well as taking on his share of the mortgage you would also need to find cash to pay him for his share of the flat's increase in value since you bought it. That would be calculated as half of: £330,000 minus the £25,000 your mother contributed minus the outstanding mortgage debt (assumed to be £173,000), which comes to £66,000 that you need to find. So, sadly, to be able to buy out your ex you need him to agree to use the value of the flat when you bought it and simply pay him £5,000 to return the cash he paid as a deposit. Whether that would be fair is up to your ex-partner to decide.</p><p></p><p>As far as stamp duty land tax (SDLT) goes, it would be payable on the amount of mortgage you took on plus whatever you pay him in cash. But you would only have to pay SDLT if that total was in excess of £125,000.</p>","headline":"How do we split a flat that has risen in value?","trailText":"<strong>Property advice</strong> My ex and I put in different deposits and I want to take on his portion of the mortgage","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yjpd","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/7/1389097951515/Some-pound-coins-with-a-M-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2014/1/7/1389097951515/Some-pound-coins-with-a-M-006.jpg","wordcount":"508","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426475637","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8520134","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Virginia Wallis","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2022205","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-11T07:00:03Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/08/how-split-flat-risen-value-different-deposits","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/jan/08/how-split-flat-risen-value-different-deposits","tags":[{"id":"money/series/expertsproperty","webTitle":"Ask the experts: homebuying","type":"series","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/expertsproperty","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/series/expertsproperty","references":[]},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/property","references":[]},{"id":"money/houseprices","webTitle":"House prices","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/houseprices","references":[]},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money","type":"keyword","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/money","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/money/money","references":[]},{"id":"profile/virginiawallis","webTitle":"Virginia Wallis","r2ContributorId":"19171","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/virginia_wallis_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Virginia Wallis is a freelance personal finance journalist who contributes regularly to Guardian Unlimited Money as well as acting as the site's expert on homebuying.
