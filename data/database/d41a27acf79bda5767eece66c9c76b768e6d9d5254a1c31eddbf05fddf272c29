        "headline":"Uruguay's president José Mujica: no palace, no motorcade, no frills",
        "body":"<p>If anyone could claim to be leading by example in an age of austerity, it is José Mujica, Uruguay's president, who has forsworn a state palace in favour of a farmhouse, donates the vast bulk of his&nbsp;salary to social projects, flies economy class and drives an old Volkswagen Beetle.</p><p>But the former guerrilla fighter is clearly disgruntled by those who tag him \"the world's poorest president\" and – much as he would like others to adopt a more sober lifestyle – the 78-year-old has been in politics long enough to recognise the folly of claiming to be a model for anyone.</p><p>\"If I asked people to live as I live, they would kill me,\" Mujica said during an interview in his small but cosy one-bedroom home set amid chrysanthemum fields outside Montevideo.</p><p>The president is a former member of the Tupamaros guerrilla group, which was <a href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/jos%C3%A9-mujica-uruguays-robin-hood-guerrillas-9066\" title=\"\">notorious in the early 1970s for bank robberies, kidnappings and distributing stolen food and money among the poor</a>. He was shot by police six times and spent 14 years in a military prison, much of it in dungeon-like conditions.</p><p>Since becoming leader of Uruguay in 2010, however, he has won plaudits worldwide for living within his means, decrying excessive consumption and pushing ahead with policies on same-sex marriage, abortion and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/uruguay-cannabis-law-war-on-drugs-marijuana\" title=\"\">cannabis legalisation</a> that have reaffirmed Uruguay as the most socially liberal country in Latin America.</p><p>Praise has rolled in from all sides of the political spectrum. Mujica may be the only leftwing leader on the planet to win the favour of the Daily Mail, which lauded him as a trustworthy and charismatic figurehead in an article headlined: \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234003/Jose-Mujica-Uruguayan-President-lives-ramshackle-farm-gives-90-earnings-away.html\" title=\"\">Finally, A politician who DOESN'T fiddle his expenses</a>.\"</p><p>But the man who is best known as Pepe says those who consider him poor fail to understand the meaning of wealth. \"I'm not the poorest president. The poorest is the one who needs a lot to live,\" he said. \"My lifestyle is a consequence of my wounds. I'm the son of my history. There have been years when I would have been happy just to have a mattress.\"</p><p>He shares the home with his wife, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-uruguays-first-lady-no-other-040726421.html\" title=\"\">Lucía Topolansky</a>, a leading member of&nbsp;Congress who has also served as acting president.</p><p>As I near the home of Uruguay's first couple, the only security detail is two guards parked on the approach road, and Mujica's three-legged dog, Manuela.</p><p>Mujica cuts an impressively unpolished figure. Wearing lived-in clothes and well-used footwear, the bushy-browed farmer who strolls out from the porch resembles an elderly Bilbo Baggins emerging from his Hobbit hole to scold an intrusive neighbour.</p><p>In conversation, he exudes a mix of warmth and cantankerousness, idealism about humanity's potential and a weariness with the modern world – at least outside the eminently sensible shire in which he lives.</p><p>He is proud of his homeland – one of the safest and least corrupt in the region – and describes Uruguay as \"an island of refugees in a world of crazy people\".</p><p>The country is proud of its social traditions. The government sets prices for essential commodities such as milk and provides free computers and education for every child.</p><p>Key energy and telecommunications industries are nationalised. Under Mujica's predecessor, Uruguay led the world in moves to restrict tobacco consumption. Earlier this week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/uruguay-cannabis-marijuana-production-sale-law\" title=\"\">it passed the world's most sweeping marijuana regulation law, which will give the state a major role in the legal production, distribution and sale of the drug</a>.</p><p>Such actions have won praise and – along with progressive policies on abortion and gay marriage – strengthened Uruguay's reputation as a liberal country. But Mujica is almost as reluctant to accept this tag as he is to agree with the \"poorest president\" label.</p><p>\"My country is not particularly open. These measures are logical,\" he said. \"With marijuana, this is not about being more liberal. We want to take users away from clandestine dealers. But we will also restrict their right to smoke if they exceed sensible amounts of consumption. It is like alcohol. If you drink a bottle of whisky a day, then you should be treated as a sick person.\"</p><p>Uruguay's options to improve society are limited, he believes, by the power of global capital.</p><p>\"I'm just sick of the way things are. We're in an age in which we can't live without accepting the logic of the market,\" he said. \"Contemporary politics is all about short-term pragmatism. We have abandoned religion and philosophy … What we have left is the automatisation of doing what the market tells us.\"</p><p>The president lives within his means and promotes the use of renewable energy and recycling in his government's policies. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/06/rio-earth-summit\" title=\"\">United Nations' Rio+20 conference on sustainable development</a> last year, he railed against the \"blind obsession\" to achieve growth through greater consumption. But, with Uruguay's economy ticking along at a growth rate of more than 3%, Mujica – somewhat grudgingly, it seems – accepts he must deliver material expansion. \"I'm president. I'm fighting for more work and more investment because people ask for more and more,\" he said. \"I am trying to expand consumption but to diminish unnecessary consumption … I'm opposed to waste – of energy, or resources, or time. We need to build things that last. That's an ideal, but it may not be realistic because we live in an age of accumulation.\"</p><p>Asked for a solution to this contradiction, the president admits he doesn't have the answers, but the former Marxist said the search for a solution must be political. \"We can almost recycle everything now. If we lived within our means – by being prudent – the 7 billion people in the world could have everything they needed. Global politics should be moving in that direction,\" he said. \"But we think as people and countries, not as a species.\"</p><p>Mujica and his wife chat fondly about meetings with Che Guevara, and the president guesses he is probably the last leader in power to have met Mao Zedong, but he has mixed feelings about the recent revolts and protests in Brazil, Turkey, Egypt and elsewhere. \"The world will always need revolution. That doesn't mean shooting and violence. A revolution is when you change your thinking. Confucianism and Christianity were both revolutionary,\" he said.</p><p>But he is cynical about demonstrations organised by social networks that quickly dissolve before they have a capacity to build anything lasting. \"The protesters will probably finish up working for multinationals and dying of modern diseases. I hope that I am wrong about that.\"</p><h2><strong>Life history</strong><br />Shot, arrested, jailed and elected</h2><p><strong>1969</strong> Active in the Tupamaros revolutionary group, which earned a reputation as the \"Robin Hood guerrillas\" by robbing delivery trucks and banks and distributing the food and money among the poor.</p><p></p><p><strong>1970</strong> Arrested for the first of four times.

        "headline":"Painted ladies: why women get tattoos",
        "body":"<p>The first tattoo I ever saw belonged to&nbsp;my grandad. He had it done in Scotland during his national service in the 50s, so the tattoo must have been more than 30 years old when I&nbsp;became fascinated by it. I used to ask him to roll up his shirtsleeve and I would use&nbsp;my finger to follow the outline of a woman cheekily reclining in a margarita glass. The shading that was supposed to indicate the flirty curl of the woman's toes had become a faded, bluish blur. Now and again, he'd wink and say it was a picture of my granny. She would purse her lips in pretend disapproval. My grandad died over 15 years ago and I'd have to look at a photograph to remember the details of his face, but I can always remember that tattoo.</p><p>I was raised in a religious household where tattoos were verboten; the body was a temple and women even hesitated over piercing their ears. Modesty in all things was required, especially for girls, and a flash of colour on the skin was a desecration of a holy vessel made in God's image. So I went and had my first tattoo done when I was 16. I was out on my own for the first time, throwing myself headlong into making my mark, and letting the world mark me.</p><p>My college had a small fund for students in dire financial circumstances. At the beginning of the year, I was given a cheque for £50 and told to spend it on books. I did. At the end of the year, the fund had been underspent and what was left was divided between the students who'd already received an allowance from it. I took my £300 and went to Manchester with my best friend. We bought books, clothes and tattoos: I got a star on my back, he got something similar, but not matching, on his upper arm.</p><p>On the train home, we peeled off our dressings to admire and compare. The parlour wasn't exemplary: the tattooist should have asked my age and turned me away, and I certainly wouldn't be so impulsive now. But even so, my star reminds me of the most enduring friendship I've had, the optimism that characterised my late teen years and my innate disobedience. These are all good things, and none of them, like the tattoo itself, is an aspect of myself I'd want to rub out and forget. It wasn't rebellion, it was reclamation. My first mark reads: this skin is mine.</p><p>But what if a tattoo turns out to be a mistake –&nbsp;not a mark, but a scar? Despite the increasing availability of procedures aimed at removing tattoo ink from the skin, most of us go under the gun knowing full well that the image will be permanent – that's part of the attraction. I've heard plenty of jokes about impulsive engravings of a beloved's name, resolved with expensive cover-up work once the relationship has ended.</p><p>When I was 19, I went to a studio in Cambridge with my then boyfriend and we had simple circles tattooed on the inside of our wrists. The ink lasted longer than the relationship did – of course, that's what happens when you're too optimistic for your own good – but the tattoo is no less important for that. Our daughter likes to trace the circle on my wrist with her finger and hear the story about why and how we got them. Relationships come and go, but some people's histories are always entwined with each other, and some of us like to write our histories on our skin. This mark reads: you were here.</p><p>Tattoos can be useful or beautiful or a combination of the two. That's reason enough. Sailors used to get images of Christ inked on to their backs to make the first mate reluctant to use the whip on them. They'd ask for elaborate designs on their limbs to mark voyages taken and ports visited – a&nbsp;kind of indelible dog tag that, they hoped, would identify a corpse lost at sea and washed ashore. Every mark had a story. The most striking tattoo I've seen is a full back piece depicting a Japanese woman wearing a red, richly patterned kimono, falling open to show her breastfeeding a standing toddler. The woman has the back of her hand over her eyes – bored, perhaps, or frustrated by demands this particular task of motherhood is placing upon her. But she's smiling. The artwork must have taken hours and cost hundreds, if not thousands – the folds of the kimono look like a breeze would lift and ripple them. My daughter liked it, too. She called it \"the mummy in the red dress\". I had a photograph of it stuck over my writing desk for years.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424912003'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386764143510/Jenn-Ashworth-009.jpg' alt='Jenn Ashworth' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jenn Ashworth: 'When I was 19, I went to a studio in Cambridge with my then boyfriend and we had simple circles tattooed on the inside of our wrists. The ink lasted longer than the relationship.' Photograph: Christina Theisen and Eleni Stefanou</figcaption></figure><p>What if the marks we make on our skin don't stay beautiful? I have a tattoo five inches lower than my belly button – a waxing and waning moon entwined with my daughter's initials. Friends warned me against it. If you get pregnant again, the most imaginative advised, the letters will stretch out like they're written on a blown-up balloon. Even the tattoo artist warned me that the skin was delicate there and the ink might not stand the test of time.</p><p>They were right. I did have another child, by a&nbsp;caesarean section, no less, and although the surgeon did her best to avoid the tattoo, complications resulted in a wider-than usual incision. The thick, white scar that denotes my son's entrance into the world runs across the tattoo. The skin around it is dotted with marks where the staples joined me back together, the puckers where the drains at the site of the wound were placed. By some people's standards, this is a&nbsp;mangled piece of body art, not pretty and not sexy. But it was never meant to be those things. I&nbsp;wouldn't dream of having it altered to cover up the record written on my body of what motherhood means. This mark reads: some things hurt.</p><p>Some things I have heard about women's tattoos: they are chavvy, common, tasteless. They are a mark of the slut, the slapper, the loose woman. Men's tattoos might be about allegiance to a gang, a subculture, a faith or a family. They might be to memorialise a lover or child, remember a journey, a period of time in prison or a religious conversion. Why are women's tattoos often viewed in terms of their sexual attractiveness, or the indicator they are perceived to give about her availability? Why is women's skin still considered public property she has no right to alter? Apparently, these marks of mine are a waste of money and they're just going to fade, blur and sag.</p><p>It's true. The ink will age at the same rate as I do – just like my grandad's did. That's fine with me. The marks aren't decoration, aren't designed to draw the gaze or enhance a feature, and even if they were, what's wrong with skin that looks the age it is, rather than the air-brushed and painted flawlessness of an eternal 20-year-old? What's wrong with bellies, arms and breasts that loosen and relax as the years pass? I want my tattoos to look the age they are.</p><p>Of course, there are plenty of reasons to dislike tattoos – like any piece of art, not every style will be to everyone's taste. To some, the permanence will never appeal. Or perhaps there's nothing as beautiful to their eyes as unmarked flesh. Jewish friends have told me they wouldn't dream of having their skin inked, not only knowing but feeling the particular history of forced tattooing, used in concentration and labour camps like branding on cattle. Some women friends consider any form of body modification, from bra-wearing to eyebrow-plucking, to be a betrayal of deeply felt feminist principles.</p><p>For others, I suspect the vehement dislike of tattoos is really a fear of women's skin. When a&nbsp;woman makes her own mark on it, she isn't quite as available to receive whatever fantasies you might want to project on to her. If skin is a&nbsp;screen, and a woman writes on it, she is telling the world (or even just herself) that her own standards of attractiveness are more important to her than the standards of anyone else who might cross her path. She is taking ownership.</p><p>Some say tattoos are addictive – that it starts with a butterfly on the hip and ends with full sleeves and a septum piercing. Maybe. It's been a&nbsp;while since I was last inked, but I've been planning my next for some time. A compass on my foot. To remind me of where I'm going, and of&nbsp;times I might forget.</p><h2>Elise Harrison, furniture/product design&nbsp;student, 25</h2><p>(Pictured top) My dad has&nbsp;no idea I&nbsp;have tattoos. I&nbsp;cover up when I see him and wear fingerless gloves –&nbsp;I&nbsp;have to tell him they're in fashion. I only really see my parents at Christmas. It would be&nbsp;a nightmare if&nbsp;we were somewhere hot. My dad is&nbsp;old-fashioned: he thinks all tattooed people are prostitutes or criminals. That's the background he comes from.</p><p>The pain is a weirdly enjoyable feeling. The unicorn on my arm was my first big one. Obviously it hurt, but it makes you feel as if you've gone through something to achieve it. You have to have guts to have a tattoo.</p><p>I've got a panther on my arm because it's what Ginger Spice from the Spice Girls has. I used to love them so much. I'd wanted her panther tattoo since I was nine. The tattoos on my arm don't really flow, but that sums me up. I'm impulsive and disorganised. It's organised chaos.</p><p>I've got a couple of ex-girlfriends' names tattooed on me, too. Whenever I get a new girlfriend, they're a bit jealous. I sometimes think about erasing them, but that would be like pretending it didn't happen. My body is like a scrapbook.</p><h2>Juanita Carberry, merchant navy steward (passed away in&nbsp;July, aged&nbsp;88)</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424912004'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386764542857/Juanita-Carberry-011.jpg' alt='Juanita Carberry' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Juanita Carberry started getting tattoos during her 17 years in the merchant navy. Photograph: Christina Theisen and Eleni Stefanou </figcaption></figure><p>The daughter of a&nbsp;renegade Irish peer, Carberry lived&nbsp;an extraordinarily full life. Her childhood in Kenya was difficult: her mother, a well-known aviator, died when she was three, and Carberry was often beaten by her governess. As a teenager, she was a key witness in a celebrated murder case, the 1941 shooting of the 22nd Earl of Erroll, and at 17 she joined the first aid nursing yeomanry in the Women's Territorials during the second world war. In 1946, Carberry became one of a handful of women to join the merchant navy, remaining for 17 years. It was during this period, says photographer Christina Theisen, that she started acquiring tattoos. Her first was a small spider on the sole of her foot; it didn't hurt, Theisen recalls Carberry saying, because the skin on her feet was so tough from walking barefoot as a child. Her seven tattoos are of animals; in later life, she became active in animal welfare. On her left shoulder is an African fish eagle. \"The tattooist got the fish the wrong way round,\" says Theisen. \"She was so upset\". Above that is an elephant. On her right shoulder is an albatross: \"She wanted to come back as one when she died.\"</p><h2>Sukran Sahin, journalist, 33</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424912005'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386764891033/Sukran-Sahin-008.jpg' alt='Sukran Sahin' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sukran Sahin: 'It felt empowering to create something irreversible and visible, and not to be afraid of what others think.' Photograph: Christina Theisen and Eleni Stefanou</figcaption></figure><p>I got my tattoo about nine years ago,&nbsp;when I was 24, so I wasn't that young and it wasn't on a whim. I was thinking about it for a year. I'm&nbsp;not sure why I chose an anchor. I&nbsp;guess I&nbsp;like the maritime theme. The writing on it is more significant. It says, \"The common breed\", which is a line from a Suede song. Suede sang about life on the margins, in council homes. I'm from a working-class immigrant background, and for the first time I felt sure about my identity. I wanted to do something to remind me of that moment. It felt empowering to create something irreversible and visible, and not to be afraid of what others might think. I'm not frightened of being judged –&nbsp;and women with tattoos are often judged, more than men.</p><p>I felt the tattoo artist talked me into getting it a bit bigger and more&nbsp;elaborate than I would have liked. But I've never regretted it. In&nbsp;fact, I'm&nbsp;thinking of adding some&nbsp;colour. My family's reaction was a bit sceptical. They asked whether I could remove it. My&nbsp;mother wasn't too happy, but I&nbsp;wasn't expecting her to&nbsp;be.</p><p>I'm going to get another one: a&nbsp;hand holding a pen, on the same arm. Pen and paper have always accompanied me. I might do more in&nbsp;time. There's loads of space.</p><h2>Candy Fathers, therapist, 39</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424912006'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386765230235/Candy-Fathers-008.jpg' alt='Candy Fathers' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Candy Fathers: 'More of my body is covered with tattoos than not.' Photograph: Christina Theisen and Eleni Stefanou </figcaption></figure><p>I get a release from having tattoos. It's therapeutic, like I'm translating my feelings into ink on my&nbsp;body. I&nbsp;have six, but they're large because I've added to them over the years. One on my back runs from my neck to the top of my arse, and I've got one the length of each arm, one on each foot and lower leg, and a gekko that circles my belly button. For my 40th next year, my friends are paying for me to have the backs of my arms done. More of my body is covered with tattoos than not.</p><p>A good friend has done them all except one. He designs them, too. I&nbsp;don't see it until he sketches it out in pen on my arm, just before the needle goes in. I trust him. If they start to feel dated, I modernise them. Celtic bands look old hat now, but roses and swallows are classics.</p><p>People often ask, \"What will you do when you get old?\" It's a strange question: I'll get old, and have tattoos. I'm happy with them now and I'll be happy with them when I'm older. They are part of me.</p><h2>Zoe Kinross, film student, 28</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424912007'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386765449224/Zoe-Kinross--008.jpg' alt='Zoe Kinross ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Zoe Kinross: 'Tattoos are markers to show how I was feeling at the time. They don’t have to have huge symbolism.' Photograph: Christina Theisen and Eleni Stefanou </figcaption></figure><p>The tattoo on my arm is my third, but the first was on my ankle –&nbsp;a Day of the Dead-style skull with roses. I got it as a way of prompting myself to move forward, to have something that reminded me where I&nbsp;wanted to get to: I wanted to get to Mexico. The second – a peony on my shoulder – was done in Mexico. That was more spontaneous. I was feeling very happy. Tattoos are markers on my body to show how I was feeling at the time. They don't have to have huge symbolism.</p><p>I'd heard the ankle is the most painful place to have a tattoo, but the place that hurt most was my arm, where I have a zebra. It was excruciating, because it went into my armpit, where I now know there&nbsp;are a lot of nerves. I don't particularly like that area of my arm, and getting the tattoo meant I had to confront that. It was like taking control. Zebras are beautiful, and as their name starts with the same letter as my name, they had an extra significance for me as a kid. A whole zebra wouldn't work in the space, so we did a head. It took me a while to get used to it, but I enjoy seeing it poking out of a shirt.</p><h2>Sami Spagnuolo, Masseuse and nutritionist, 35</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424912008'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386766001300/Sami-Spagnuolo-009.jpg' alt='Sami Spagnuolo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sami Spagnuolo: 'I don’t dress to show them off, but you don’t get tattoos unless you want them to be a talking point.' Photograph: Christina Theisen and Eleni Stefanou </figcaption></figure><p>Every one of my tattoos records an event or rite of passage. I&nbsp;think of tattoos as art, but also, every time I&nbsp;look at mine, I relive the emotions I&nbsp;felt when I had them.</p><p>I got my first tattoo at 20, and I've got 13 now. I don't get them done straight away; I plan them in&nbsp;detail. I&nbsp;have a few tattoo artists I particularly like; each has a different style, so I know how they'd approach a design. I go to conventions a lot, so I'm familiar with the best artists' work.</p><p>The one on my chest is the heart, or fourth chakra – I got it two years ago. I've got a pretty one of flowers on my arm, and one behind my knee of a hand holding a chilli pepper up to some teeth. But the chakra is the one people respond to. I don't exactly dress to show them off, but I&nbsp;guess you don't get tattoos unless you want them to be a talking point.</p><p>I'm planning a new one: a skinny girl with her wrists tied for my calf. It relates to a time I put on a lot of weight and really suffered, before I&nbsp;realised that being thin is a trap.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.womenwithtattoos.co.uk\">womenwithtattoos.co.uk</a></p><p>• This article was edited on 13 December 2013.

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Andy Bull: </strong> On 29 January 2011, 14-year-old Ben Robinson played rugby union for his school. After being treated three times for blows to the head and sent back to the field on each occasion, he collapsed and later died in hospital. Behind his profoundly tragic story is another of a sport in denial, where authorities at all levels dither over treating concussion while all the time, players grow stronger, heavier and the hits get ever bigger</p>",
        "headline":"Death of a schoolboy: why concussion is rugby union's dirty secret",
        "body":"<p>The house is silent, but the silence speaks. It tells a story. Once, a boy lived here, who was loud. Not like his sister. Their mother seldom knew whether the girl was in or out, but she could always tell when her son was home. She could hear him, even when he was holed up in the front room playing computer games. He filled the house. Now he is gone, and in his absence, there is silence. And so the silence speaks.</p><p>Awesome. Loving. Vibrant. These are the three words Karen Walton and Peter Robinson chose to describe their son, Benjamin. They are carved in stone in a cemetery outside the small town of Carrickfergus, in Northern Ireland. Ben was 14 when he died, from brain injuries inflicted while playing rugby union for his school, Carrickfergus Grammar, against Dalriada. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23943642\" title=\"\">In September a coroner determined</a> that the cause of death was a rare condition called Second Impact Syndrome. But behind those words is a simpler one, a word Karen describes as \"rugby's dirty secret\". Ben Robinson died because of concussion.</p><p>Ben took too many blows to the head in too short a space of time. His death could, and should, have been prevented. \"For something like this to happen,\" Peter says, \"there have to be so many failings. And on that day, unfortunately for Ben, there were so many failings.\" There should have been a chain of health-and-safety procedures in place, one that included players, coaches, referees and parents. If just one link in that chain had worked as it should have, Ben's concussion would have been spotted. He would have been removed from the pitch, and he may have survived.</p><p>The coroner said Ben was the first person in the UK to die of Second Impact Syndrome while playing rugby. Karen, whose life has been shattered, says she is certain Ben will not be the last. \"Will this happen again?\" she asks. \"Yes. I would say without a doubt another family will go through what we have been through.\" Since 2006, at least five children and one adult have died, worldwide, from brain injuries suffered while playing rugby. Second Impact Syndrome is rare. Concussion is not. Neither are the injuries it causes.</p><p>Karen's house is silent, but the silence speaks. It tells its own story. Of a boy's death and a family's grief. It tells the story of a sport in denial about the risks being taken by those who play it, struggling to square the blood, guts and glory attitude of its amateur days with the brutal power of the professional game, and riven with disagreement about how to deal with its single most important issue – concussion.</p><h2><strong>'He was nervous, said he didn't want to let anyone down'</strong></h2><p>Before Ben Robinson went to Carrickfergus Grammar, he didn't care for rugby. His father, Peter, had played it, and his stepfather, Steven, still did. Ben preferred football. He didn't get rugby and he was the kind of boy who didn't warm to things he couldn't fathom. But he found himself in the school team all the same, playing at centre, because he had some talent for it. \"This was a kid,\" his mother says, \"who would miss rugby training after school, because he wasn't that keen, but still be on the team sheet at the weekend anyway.\" As Ben got older, and learned a little about the sport from his dad and stepdad, he began to enjoy it more. Until, in his third year, he won a prize for most improved player. \"Things,\" Karen says, \"were falling into place for him.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-424711666\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/11/131211RugbyConcussion-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/11/131211RugbyConcussion_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/11//131211RugbyConcussion.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2013/12/11/131211RugbyConcussion/131211RugbyConcussion.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/11/131211RugbyConcussion_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Ben loved the rough-and-tumble. There had been a time when he wanted to be a stuntman. Karen once looked out of the window and saw him in the street, tied to a skateboard attached to his sister's bike, ready for some daredevil trick. She told him there wasn't much calling for professional stuntmen and suggested he might want to think of another career. She wondered if he might want to become a physio. When his stepfather broke his leg playing rugby, Ben would massage it for him, and ask him where it hurt. He was fascinated by the pins put in to hold the bones together. He was a smart boy but liked to get by doing as little as he could. He would talk back, too. \"I would always say to him: 'You are going to be the boy who gets smacked because you are talking when you should have been listening.'\"</p><p>Ben was starting to learn, though. The coach at Carrickfergus told Karen, \"I don't know what you have said to your son, but he has managed to keep quiet.\" Carrickfergus wasn't what you might call a rugby school, not like Campbell or Methody, but they took the game seriously. Ben was on a conditioning program to help him bulk up. He would come home with a sheet that listed exercises he should be doing: how many miles he should run in how many minutes, which weights he should lift and how often.</p><p>The match against Dalriada mattered more than most. It was in the second round of the Medallion Shield, the Ulster Under-15s competition. It is the last level before the players go on to the Schools Cup, which is for Under‑18s. The winter had been cold and the game had been postponed over and again because of frozen ground. Finally it was pencilled in for 29 January 2011. \"That's great,\" Karen said to Ben. \"I'll be able to go and watch you.\" She went to most of his home games and a few away ones, too. She didn't know much about rugby – \"You pass it back to go forward, and that's about it\" – but she understood what the match meant to her son. That week he had forgotten his kit for after-school training but he took part anyway, holding the rucking pads while the other kids hit them.</p><p>The day before the game, Ben watched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/03/invictus-nelson-mandela-rugby-clint-eastwood-reel-history\" title=\"\">Invictus</a>, Clint Eastwood's film about the South Africa side that won the 1995 World Cup. Karen was out watching Ben's sister play football. She called him home to ask what he wanted for supper. Pasta. That, after all, was what the professionals ate before a match. But Karen was late back. She didn't have time to cook, so she picked up some Kentucky Fried Chicken. When she got in, Ben was standing up at the top of the stairs in his rugby kit. \"What are you doing?\" she asked. \"Do I look the part?\" Ben replied. \"Do I look OK?\" Steven started to snigger, but Karen shushed him. \"Don't laugh, this is an important thing for him.\"</p><p>Ben came down to the kitchen to eat, still in his kit. Talk turned to tomorrow's game. He was nervous, said he didn't want to let anyone down. \"It's just rugby. Just do your best, and if you do your best no one can ask anything more of you,\" Karen told him. \"I want to do my best,\" he said. That night he slept in his kit.</p><p>In the morning Karen dropped Ben's sister at school for a hockey match. When she got back, she made him some scrambled eggs, because all he'd eaten for breakfast was a banana. On the way to the ground they stopped at the garage to pick up supplies. Ben had a little ritual after every match, he liked to settle down with the Sun and a Pot Noodle. He had his iPod on, one earphone in, the other hanging free so that he could talk to his mum. They were close and called each other by their nicknames, Mama Bear and Baby Bear. As they drove down the lane to school, Ben said: \"You know, I am going to have to stop being Baby Bear, because when I'm 15 I will be playing against 18‑year‑olds.\" Karen thought for a moment. \"OK,\" she said. \"But you know you'll always be Baby Bear to Mummy Bear?\" \"Yeah,\" Ben said. \"Yeah, yeah.\"</p><p>The car stopped. Karen remembers that Ben just sat there. \"I thought: 'He is not going to get out of the car,' so I said: 'Right, well, I am just going to go back to the house, collect Steven, and then we'll be back up to watch.'\" He finally got out. \"OK.\" He flashed her a thumbs-up as she pulled away.</p><h2><strong>'</strong>And I just knew. I just knew. My only son, my youngest, had gone'</h2><p>Have you ever heard of the Scat? If you haven't, you are in good company. The acronym stands for <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/47/5/259.full.pdf\" title=\"\">Standardised Concussion Assessment Tool</a>. The pocket version <a href=\"http://www.thinkfirst.ca/downloads/concussion/concussion-recognition-tool.pdf\" title=\"\">is a card that lists the nine \"red flag\" symptoms</a>. If any one of those nine is detected, the Scat says in red text, \"the player should be safely and immediately removed from the field.\" The Scat was drawn up at the <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/47/5/250.full\" title=\"\">Zurich International Consensus Conference for Concussion in Sport</a>, which is held every four years. The IRB is represented at the Consensus Conference, as is Fifa, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Ice Hockey Federation.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424934771'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386943741035/The-reminder-card--008.jpg' alt='The reminder card ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The reminder card now handed out by Peter Robinson, about recognising concussion in rugby union. Photograph: Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>It takes seconds to download and print a Scat card. Every rugby coach, every rugby referee, should have the latest edition – <a href=\"http://www.thinkfirst.ca/downloads/concussion/concussion-recognition-tool.pdf\" title=\"\">the Scat3</a> – in their pocket. But the blunt truth is that most club and school players, coaches, and referees have never heard of it. To get a Scat card from the IRB, you have to find it on their website and download your own copy. As Peter Robinson says, it feels as if \"the IRB ask people to go online and educate themselves\". They do not issue Scat cards as standard. In fact, the edition of the Scat <a href=\"http://www.irbplayerwelfare.com/pdfs/SCAT2_EN.pdf\" title=\"\">available from the IRB is four years out of date</a>. It was superseded by a new version earlier this year. Superseded everywhere, that is, <a href=\"http://irbplayerwelfare.com/?documentid=8\" title=\"\">except on the IRB's website</a>. The referee in charge of the match between Carrickfergus Grammar and Dalriada admitted at the first hearing, which took place almost a year after Ben's death, that he had never heard of the Scat. Neither had the Carrickfergus coach.</p><p>Karen arrived at the ground just in time to see Ben running into a ruck. \"The force of it shocked me,\" she says. \"He hit those boys and his whole upper body just whipped back.\" She had never seen him play with such energy, such ferocity. \"He seemed to be involved in everything. It was just hit after hit after hit.\" She started to worry. \"You take away that fancy name, 'rugby',\" she says, \"and you have got a group of 30 boys slamming and banging off each other for 80 minutes. In the street, at what stage are you going to say: 'Sort that out, somebody is going to get hurt?' But you put the ball in, and you call it sport.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424934773'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386939357437/Graphicrugbyinjuriesmedical.png' alt='Graphic, rugby injuries: medical attendance' width='200' height='761' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>At half-time Karen turned to Steven and said: \"Ben has done his bit, I want him off.\" She wanted to go on to the pitch herself, to check on her boy. She had done it before. But she knew it embarrassed him. \"Don't come on, Mum,\" he'd say. \"Nothing is going to happen to me.\" So she sent Steven instead. \"Did you speak to him?\" Karen asked. \"No, but I chatted to the referee.\" \"And what did he say?\" \"He said he is a great wee player, very enthusiastic.\" That didn't calm Karen. \"The referee is there,\" Steven said. \"The coach is there. He seems fine.\" The coroner found that there were no \"major incidents\" involving Ben in the first half, but Karen thinks there were many minor ones.</p><p>There is video footage of the match. It was a key piece of evidence, because, as the coroner said, the \"frailty of the human memory when recalling traumatic events\" meant that \"many of the witnesses were confused regarding timings\". It was filmed by one of the Dalriada boys. Peter made himself sick watching it, but now he has seen the tape so many times he has become desensitised to it. \"I realised that the first time I showed it in court, and heard the gasps from all the other people. I realised again that I was watching Ben's last moments.\"</p><p>In the video, the action takes place in the background. In front, the schoolboy spectators are larking around, telling jokes and pulling faces. They are oblivious to the tragedy unfolding in front of them. Over their shoulders, you catch sight of Ben, conspicuous in his distinctive body armour, one arm black, the other white. You see him accelerating into a hard tackle. He is knocked to the ground. He stays there for 90 seconds. At the inquest, the Carrickfergus coach remembered that Ben stood up on his own, one of a series of misremembered facts that Peter and Karen disproved by showing the video. Ben was helped to his feet. Soon after he is hit again. It looks like there is a clash of heads. These two blows happened in the space of the first four minutes of the second half.</p><p>The video cuts. You see Ben holding his head. He walks over to the coach, who does a concussion test on him and decides he can play on. The coach didn't remember how that conversation went. The video cuts again. Now Ben is hobbling, holding his head, walking away from play. The coroner found that Ben continued to \"play enthusiastically\", and \"displayed no immediately obvious physical signs that anything was amiss\", but in the video, his symptoms clearly tally with those described on the Scat card. Again, you see the coach giving him a concussion test, holding up fingers in front of his face. In the end, it transpired that Ben was checked for concussion three times during the match, and each time he was allowed to play on. There was a doctor at the match, the father of a Dalriada player who hurt his leg in one of the collisions with Ben. He missed the symptoms too. \"In court he said by the time he got over to Ben he was already up on his feet,\" Peter remembers. The video showed that he too was mistaken.</p><p>Karen wasn't oblivious. She was pacing up and down the side of the pitch. \"There were stoppages, and I knew they were for Benjamin. I saw the coach doing the fingers test, moving them from left to right.\" Once, she was sure she saw the referee rolling his eyes. He admitted as much in the inquest, saying he thought some of the players were being \"prima donnas and drama queens\". Ben was heard to say: \"I am not remembering this.\" The video shows Ben talking to his fellow centre, who said at the inquest that Ben had told him: \"I can't remember the score.\"</p><p>\"He had this very confused smile on his face,\" Karen remembers. \"And I was thinking: 'That's not right.' But I was also thinking: 'He has been checked. He has been assessed. He is OK.'\" She started to cry out to him: \"Benjamin! Benjamin!\" The referee told her to calm down. It made her think she was being silly. Just another over-protective mother. \"I could see Ben, away to the left of me.\" He started to stagger. She cried again: \"Benjamin! Benjamin!\" and he turned to her and said: \"I don't feel right.\" As she walked towards him, the ball came his way and he was sucked back into play. The game was almost over. People were shouting for the referee to blow his whistle. Karen told herself: \"Just another minute.\" Then there was another stoppage. Karen turned to Steven. \"Is it Benjamin?\" She started running. She was halfway across the pitch when she passed the Carrickfergus captain. \"It's Ben,\" he told her. \"He is out cold.\"</p><p>On the video Ben is flat out. One of the witnesses remembered that Ben made a tackle, stood up, then collapsed backwards. \"That was it,\" Peter says. \"He didn't regain consciousness.\"</p><p>\"I got there and he was lying flat on his back. The whites of his eyes were looking up at me, and he was gasping for breath,\" Karen says. \"And everything clicked into place.\" All the doubts slipped away. \"He had been involved in too many hits, too many tackles.\" She got down on her knees, held his arm, told him \"Benjamin, Mama's here\", and wrapped him in her coat. Karen was a policewoman. She had an idea of what to do, and tried to put him into the recovery position. But he kept slumping forward. \"And I just knew. I just knew. I was hit with the very cold, hard, realisation that the son I love and adore, my only son, my youngest, had gone.\"</p><h2>'My world fell apart. It really did come crashing down'</h2><p>For Karen, it's as though the clock stopped on 29 January. \"People tell me time is a great healer,\" she says. \"It isn't. It only gets harder. My yesterday will always be January 29th. Benjamin is missed every second of every day.\" She struggles to remember what she did yesterday, the day before, or the week before, but recalls every little detail of the last days of his life.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424934774'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386939357781/Graphicrugbyinjuriestimeout.png' alt='Graphic, rugby injuries: time out' width='200' height='761' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>\"That whole day, the days leading up to the game, I remember the conversations we had, the jokes we shared, the laughs.\" Then things begin to fracture. There are pieces of memories, isolated images, clips of conversation. The interminable ambulance ride. Pacing the waiting rooms. A nurse saying: \"He is going to be OK.\" A consultant offering no such assurances. The sight, through a door window, of a neurologist talking to a nurse, and how, when the nurse hung her head, Karen knew what was coming. \"I kicked, punched, screamed, fought. I do remember periods of that.\" She heard someone wailing. Realised with a start that it was her. \"It is almost like you are part of it. But you are not part of it, you are looking in.\" On the Monday, the medical staff ran two sets of tests. They injected ice cold water into his ear. There was no response. \"My world fell apart. It really did come crashing down.\"</p><p>It wasn't the first blow that killed Ben Robinson. It was the fact that he played on, and was hit again. Dr Willie Stewart is one of Britain's leading neuropathologists. He has become one of the key figures in the campaign to reform rugby's concussion rules. He explains: \"Second Impact Syndrome is incredibly poorly understood.\" The significant point, Stewart says, is that adolescent brains can swell uncontrollably after a single bang on the head. \"The first one causes the blood vessels to become a bit leaky,\" he says. \"The second one cause them to become much worse, and that leads to brain swelling.\" The second blow does not have to be concussive. A glancing blow, a jar, is enough to exacerbate the swelling. Which is why it is essential to remove a player as soon as signs of concussion are detected.</p><p>At first, Peter and Karen were told by the hospital staff and representatives of the Ulster branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union that it was probably a freak accident, the result of one bad tackle and a single blow to the head. \"He had more chance,\" one nurse said, \"of being hit by lightning.\" It was only six months later, when the pathologist's report came back, that they learned a little of the truth. They would have to fight to uncover its entirety. \"When we were first told about what happened, Ben's injuries were described as a one‑off collision,\" Peter says. This, he feels, was the explanation that the authorities were most comfortable with. \"It meant there was no comeback.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424934769'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386943482708/Peter-Robinson-008.jpg' alt='Peter Robinson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Peter Robinson, pictured at a rugby club near his home in Rosewell, Midlothian in December 2013. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>\"I am so grateful to that pathologist,\" Karen says. \"Because he refused to accept the theory that it was just one blow. He went on his gut instinct: that Ben was a young, fit, healthy, boy, and the idea that it was just one blow didn't make sense.\" The pathologist found that Ben had three brain injuries, and it was probable that they had all been inflicted in that one match. \"He likened Ben's injuries to those you'd see in somebody who had been involved in a car crash.\" The findings didn't square with what Karen and Peter had been told to that point. The school declined the opportunity to be interviewed for this article. In a statement, Carrickfergus Grammar said: \"Benjamin Robinson was a highly popular, outgoing and able young man whose tragic death in January 2011 remains keenly felt both in and beyond the Carrickfergus Grammar School community. The board of governors extends its continued heartfelt condolences to his parents and family.\"</p><h2>'Something positive has to come out of this'</h2><p>That October, Karen was visiting Ben's grave, as she does every day, when one of his old school team-mates came jogging past. He stopped, and as the two spoke he started to cry. He said Ben's friends still didn't understand why he was dead. He said that during the match he knew that Ben had been knocked out. \"This,\" says Peter, \"is where it started to come out.\" Karen asked the boy: \"Why didn't you didn't tell the police that?\" She was a policewoman herself, and specialised in family trauma. \"These are kids who have had no dealings with the police,\" she explains. \"It is a very daunting experience. And it was very brave of them to speak out. It was a huge, huge thing for them to do at that age. I am grateful to those boys for coming forward and saying: 'Look, Benjamin didn't look right, he didn't remember the score.'\"</p><p>Peter and Karen, who were both in the police, hired a solicitor because they felt so uneasy with the way the investigation was going. \"I suppose because I was in the police and I know how investigations should work, especially where kids are subjected to trauma. And it wasn't going the way I would have conducted it.\" Then, when they arrived at the inquest, they discovered that the school had hired a barrister. The process became, Peter says, \"adversarial\". They had to fight to prove Ben should have been taken off the pitch, that he could have survived. It was, Karen says, \"a very difficult time\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424934770'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386943227480/Karen-Walton-and-Peter-Ro-008.jpg' alt='Karen Walton and Peter Robinson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Karen Walton and Peter Robinson, speaking to the media in Belfast after the inquest into Ben's death. Photograph: Paul Faith/PA Wire/Press Association Images</figcaption></figure><p>The inquest was scheduled to run for a day in September 2012. In the end it lasted six. Representatives from the Ulster branch of the IRFU arrived on the fifth day, when it became apparent that the referee, whom it had trained, was giving evidence without legal representation. The Ulster branch asked for a delay so it could prepare a report. The inquest was postponed for a year.</p><p>When it was finally over, the coroner ruled that Ben had died of SIS, the first diagnosed case in Northern Ireland and, probably, in the UK. The coroner found that Ben was concussed in the first four minutes of the second half, and that \"unfortunately neither the team coach or the referee were made aware of his neurological complaints.\" She added that this was \"a case of great public interest\" and that she would be sending her findings to the head of the IRFU and the education minister for Northern Ireland, John O'Dowd. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23943642\" title=\"\">The IRFU issued a statement</a> in which it expressed its \"deepest condolences\", stressed that \"injuries of this nature are highly unusual in rugby\" and insisted that it observes \"all international best practices, as set out by the IRB\".</p><p>The inquest was supposed to provide answers. But when it was over, Peter and Karen found that they had more questions. Why hadn't the coach or the referee spotted the symptoms of Ben's concussion? Why hadn't they known about or followed the Scat protocol? Why hadn't they removed him from play when his team-mates said he had been knocked out? Why, a year later, were those same team-mates still unsure why he had died? Why hadn't the parents themselves been told about the risks of concussion? Why hadn't the players? If the IRFU was following the \"international best practices as set out by the IRB\", why was their son dead? And if those \"best practices\" had failed once, what was to stop them failing again?</p><p>After the inquest, Peter assumed \"people would be saying what happened? How do we prevent this?\" Instead, when he first went home to Edinburgh from Northern Ireland, and left \"the bubble\", he realised that \"unless you went looking for information about concussion, you wouldn't find it.\" What scared him about rugby, he says was \"the complete lack of awareness\" about concussion, how to spot it, how to treat it, and how seriously to take it. \"For me,\" Peter explains, \"something positive has to come out of this.\" What worries him is the idea that \"Ben was another statistic\". He read about the three players who died from similar injuries since his in 2011, and he realised: \"No one has learned anything.\"</p><p>Shortly after the inquest into Ben's death, the Ulster branch of the IRFU sent a coach to the school to talk to the students about strength and conditioning, and a talent scout too. Karen was shocked they weren't sending anyone to talk about concussion, upset that they could be so insensitive. \"This could have been avoided,\" Karen says. \"It could have been. It should have been. And for the authorities to stick their head in the sand is incredibly insulting, sickening, humiliating.\" She has to live with the knowledge that she knew Ben should not have played on. \"I&nbsp;got it right. If only I had gotten it right sooner. If only I hadn't ignored it. But I thought he was in good hands. I thought they knew better than me. But they didn't. And that is hard. That is very hard to take.</p><p>\"Now it is all about getting his story out there. The more people that know the signs, symptoms and the dangers, the better. I don't want it to have been in vain. I don't want it to be for nothing. Does it change anything for us? No. Does it make it easier for me? No. Does it soften the blow? No.\" She pauses. \"I&nbsp;don't have a sideline to stand by on a Saturday morning. I have a graveside.\"</p><p><em>• Parts two and three to follow online on Saturday and in Sunday's Observer</em></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424934772'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386943798440/The-reminder-card-now-han-008.jpg' alt='The reminder card now handed out by Peter Robinson, about recognising concussion in rugby union' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The reminder card now handed out by Peter Robinson, about recognising concussion in rugby union.

But many had thought his marriage to the youthful leader's aunt – the sister of late leader Kim Jong-il – was likely to save his life.</p><p>In Pyongyang, people crowded around subway station billboards displaying the morning paper and news of the execution, Associated Press reported. Others sat quietly and listened as a radio broadcast broadcast into the subway listed Jang's crimes.</p><p>The lengthy, bombastic and at times downright bizarre report from KCNA quoted an alleged admission by Jang that he sought to destabilise the country, triggering discontent among the military and others. He planned to become premier if North Korea approached collapse and use illicitly acquired wealth to ensure that \"the people and service personnel will shout 'hurrah' for me\" and his coup would succeed smoothly\".</p><p>It also claimed he pursued a \"decadent capitalist lifestyle\" – squandering at least €4.6m in 2009 alone, including in a foreign casino – and deliberately hampered construction projects in Pyongyang.</p><p>He sold off natural resources \"at random\" and committed treachery by selling off land at the Rason special economic zone for five decades, it added, apparently in reference to a deal with Russia.</p><p>\"They are using this opportunity to scapegoat Uncle Jang by relegating responsibility for all policy failures,\" said Leonid Petrov of the Australian National University.</p><p>Other offences cited include halfhearted applause as Kim rose to power and Jang's \"reckless\" instruction to security forces to erect a granite block with Kim's signature in a shaded corner rather than in front of their headquarters.</p><p>Brian Myers, an expert on ideology at Dongseo University in Busan, noted that the denigration of Jang held potential perils for the leadership. It raised questions about his ability to cause so much damage for so long and sat uneasily with North Korea's use of collective punishment.</p><p>\"This is a member of the clan in a culture where the regime tends to punish entire families for crimes committed by one of them. So it seems odd to be so explicit about [his] crimes,\" Myers said.</p><p>KCNA said Jang had long held a \"dirty political ambition\" but dared not act while Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il were alive.</p><p>\"He began revealing his true colours, thinking that it was just the time for him to realise his wild ambition in the period of historic turn when the generation of the revolution was replaced,\" it added.</p><p>That was when Jang – who had been purged twice before – returned to the forefront of North Korean politics. Kim Jong-il appeared to have selected him as a mentor figure who could help smooth Kim Jong-un's path to power.</p><p>Adam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea, said accusations of factionalism and seeking power were \"pro forma\" in such cases, but he noted how specific the charges were and added: \"There certainly were discussions about the direction North Korea would take [when Kim Jong-il died]. It would be natural for Jang to want to be part of a collective leadership system.</p><p>\"But North Korea is not moving towards a collective system: it's all about the one leader&nbsp;… It's the divine right of Kims.\"</p><p>Myers added: \"The most surprising and unprecedented thing is not that someone was planning to overthrow the state&nbsp;… but the implication that he had a substantial number of followers. That's the first ever official admission of significant disunity in the North Korean state itself.\"</p><p>Kim has made sweeping changes to the hierarchy in North Korea, changing key military personnel repeatedly as well as removing civilian members, but family members are normally dealt with more leniently and quietly. It is unclear how the position of Jang's wife Kim Kyong Hui – also seen as something of a mentor for Kim following her brother's death – has been affected.</p><p>Nor is it clear whether Kim himself initiated his uncle's ousting or whether other parts of the elite were behind Jang's fall. While some analysts predict increased instability in the North, as those associated with Jang are removed, others argue that Kim has consolidated his position effectively.</p><p>Patrick Ventrell, White House National Security Council spokesman, said: \"If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the regime.\"</p><p>The KCNA report raises further questions about the development of North's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/north-korea-reform-kim-jong-un\" title=\"\">economic</a> and foreign policy, alleging Jang believed that after his coup his \"reformist\" reputation would encourage foreign countries to recognise him quickly.</p><p>Cathcart noted: \"Kim has been very lucky in the external environment and I think he will continue to be. For all the bile [the North has] directed at South Korea, Japan and the US and even China, none of those countries are interested in grabbing this hornets' nest and shaking it right now.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424887226|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|edbb919c44bf576139984218768cce2299a3c715 -->",

        "body":"<p>The body that represents UK universities has withdrawn guidance on the gender segregation of audiences in lectures and debates after the prime minister, David Cameron, said it should not be allowed to happen.</p><p>Universities UK said a controversial case study setting out the guidance was being withdrawn while it reviewed its stance, but insisted the legal position remained unclear on whether the voluntary separation of men and women could be allowed at events such as lectures on Islam by visiting speakers.</p><p>Cameron's spokesman had earlier said Universities UK should urgently review the guidance.</p><p>His intervention followed comments by the education secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/13/michael-gove-university-gender-segregation\" title=\"\">Michael Gove, who accused the body that represents universities of \"pandering to extremists\"</a>.</p><p>Universities UK issued the guidance following a series of Islamic events at campuses at which male and female students had been separated.</p><p>The prime minister's spokesman said: \"There is an issue around speakers who are invited into universities. He doesn't think that guest speakers should be able to address segregated audiences and he thinks that Universities UK should urgently review its guidance.</p><p>\"There is an important issue around principle and possible risks around discrimination. I think [Cameron] feels very strongly about this.\"</p><p>The spokesman made clear that the PM wanted a ban on gender-segregated audiences on campus even where men and women voluntarily separated themselves.</p><p>He also stressed that the prime minister's views did not extend to places of worship such as mosques, synagogues or gurdwaras.</p><p>The intervention comes the day after the education secretary said the guidance, which has also been branded not permissible by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), was a \"disgrace\".</p><p>\"We should not pander to extremism. Speakers who insist on segregating audiences should not be indulged by educators. This guidance is wrong and harmful. Universities UK should withdraw it immediately,\" <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2522925/Now-furious-Gove-says-disgrace-segregate-students-accuses-university-bosses-pandering-extremism.html\" title=\"\">Gove told the Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>On Thursday Universities UK, which represents more than 130 higher education institutions, said it was seeking a definitive legal view on the issue from the EHRC after its London headquarters were targeted by student protesters this week.</p><p>The EHRC said it was involved in redrafting sections in guidance that said that Muslim and other groups were permitted to voluntarily segregate men and women at events. Its chief executive, Mark Hammond, told the Telegraph: \"Equality law permits gender segregation in premises that are permanently or temporarily being used for the purposes of an organised religion where its doctrines require it.</p><p>\"However, in an academic meeting or in a lecture open to the public it is not, in the commission's view, permissible to segregate by gender.\"</p><p></p><p>The document was aimed at covering the legal issues around hosting external speakers, including how to balance the right to free speech against other considerations.</p><p>It took the example of an ultra-orthodox religious group invited to speak as part of a wider series of talks on faith, where the speaker requested the audience be segregated by gender. The guidance says that if, for example, women and men were seated separately side by side rather than men at the front and women at the back there would not necessarily be any gender inequality, and voluntary segregation could be permitted.</p><p>Universities UK said it had sought an opinion from the senior barrister Fenella Morris QC, which concluded that the advice was \"an appropriate foundation for lawful decision-making by universities\".</p><p>The guidance prompted widespread criticism and protests from students.</p><p>A Universities UK spokesman said: \"UUK's publication External Speakers in Higher Education aims to provide guidance to institutions in managing the process for inviting external speakers on to campus, both in terms of upholding principles of free speech and complying with the law.</p><p>\"It was produced with significant input from a range of organisations as well as extensive legal advice and reflected the Technical Guidance on Further and Higher Education issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p><p>\"Given the public concern in relation to a case study about gender segregation, we requested opinions from senior counsel Fenella Morris QC and from the EHRC. The advice from senior legal counsel confirms that our guidance is correct and provides an appropriate foundation for lawful decision-making.</p><p>\"For the avoidance of any doubt, we are not talking here about enforced segregation. It is very hard to see any university agreeing to a request for segregation that was not voluntary and did not have the broad support of those attending.</p><p>\"We are now working with senior legal counsel and the Equality and Human Rights Commission to review both our case study and the commission's guidance to ensure that they are consistent and clear for universities.\"</p><p>Tahir Nasser, chairman of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Students' Association UK, which regularly organises lectures on Islam on university campuses, said the prime minister's views did not take into consideration the sensitivities of other communities.</p><p>\"I completely disagree with the forced segregation of students at universities. This is really a non-issue as Muslim women and men who feel more comfortable sitting next to people of the same gender are already able to do so. Their personal preference should not be imposed upon others who have a different preference,\" he said.</p><p>\"However, at the same time, those wishing to freely sit separately should be able to do so and their rights respected just as those of others are.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424913151|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|0b6eacb2aab5b07954064ab91de4e0e2d79aed82 -->",

        "body":"<p>One of the two personal assistants accused of defrauding Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi of £685,000 has claimed that the TV cook, her art collector ex-husband and other witnesses at the trial have lied under oath.</p><p>Elisabetta Grillo, 41, and her sister, Francesca, 35, are accused of defrauding the Lawson and Saatchi household over a four-year period through the unauthorised use of credit cards and household accounts.</p><p>The pair claim Lawson allowed them to spend as they wished in exchange for them keeping her use of cocaine, class B drugs and prescription medication secret from Saatchi.</p><p>Lawson and others, however, have claimed that the credit cards issued to the sisters were not meant for personal expenditure, and should never have been used as such without authorisation, or to withdraw cash.</p><p>At the beginning of her second day of evidence at Isleworth crown court, Elisabetta Grillo was asked by Jane Carpenter, prosecuting: \"Is it your evidence that Ms Lawson has lied to the court?\"</p><p>To which she replied: \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"And Mr Saatchi?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"And you're the one telling the truth?\"</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>\"And the other PAs, have they lied as well?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p>Earlier, Elisabetta Grillo also claimed that Lawson had allowed the children in the house to smoke marijuana.</p><p>The matter arose when Grillo was asked about a New York duty-free shop bill for £69.71 that she had paid for with her work credit card. \"It was cigarettes for the children,\" she said.</p><p>Asked by Carpenter \"what on Earth\" she thought she was doing buying cigarettes for them, Grillo replied: \"Well, if Nigella let the children smoke weed …\" before Judge Robin Johnson interrupted the exchange.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>On Thursday, Elisabetta Grillo – whom Lawson has described as her \"rock\" and a \"stalwart\" – said the cook had not been telling the truth when she said under oath that she had used cocaine on only seven occasions.</p><p>The court heard that debris from drug-taking – including paper wraps, rolled-up £20 notes and credit cards with white powder on them – was found around the Belgravia house Lawson shared with Saatchi as often as \"every three days\".</p><p>The court heard that even though she had told her solicitors, Grillo's original defence case statement in August did not include allegations of Lawson's drug use because she did not want them raised in court out of a \"remnant of sympathy\" for her former boss. The claims were included in an extra statement made in November.</p><p>The additional statement, read to the court by Grillo's barrister, Anthony Metzer QC, said: \"The defendant will assert that the prosecution witness Nigella Lawson habitually indulged in the use of class A and class B drugs in addition to the abuse of prescription drugs throughout the time that the defendant was employed in the household.</p><p>\"This evidence is of substantial importance as it explains why Ms Lawson initially consented, or appeared to consent, to the expenditure as the defendants were intimately connected to her private life and were aware of the drug use which she wanted to keep from her then husband Charles Saatchi.</p><p>\"The defendant's case is that Ms Lawson's drug use and the defendant's knowledge of it materially affected her attitude to the defendant's spending and in turn her attitude to this prosecution.</p><p>\"Whilst it is not the defendant's case that there was an explicit agreement for silence in return for acquiescence in expenditure, the intimate atmosphere created by such knowledge informed their relationship and what the defendant considered was permitted by Ms Lawson.\"</p><p>The statement said the defendant suggested the reason Lawson had maintained she did not consent to the spending was because of her \"fear of Mr Saatchi\" and concern that he would think the spending had been allowed, either expressly or implicitly, by Lawson because her drug use could be exposed.</p><p>While she did not mention the drug use originally, the additional statement said: \"On mature reflection, given that this illicit use of drugs goes directly to her [Grillo's] defence of actual or implied consent, she now expressly instructs that this matter should be raised to ensure fairness in the proceedings.\"</p><p>Grillo repeatedly insisted that she had been allowed to use the card she had been given by Saatchi to withdraw cash and to make personal purchases authorised by Lawson. She said Lawson had often allowed her to treat herself using the card and had told her she could pay herself £50 every time she worked late.</p><p>\"I have said this many times,\" said Grillo. \"I worked very hard. I was part of the family and Nigella wanted to show me that she appreciated my job. I was part of the family for 14 years.\"</p><p>Asked by Carpenter if she had taken advantage of Lawson and Saatchi by using the card as she pleased, Grillo replied: \"I would never do that. Not to Nigella. Not to Charles. Especially not to Charles.\"</p><p>Grillo provoked mirth in court when she told jurors that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/13/charles-saatchi-elisabetta-grillo-bought-book-bestseller-list\" title=\"\">Saatchi had handed her cash and told her to get in a cab and buy copies of his book</a> from different shops across the capital in a bid to move it up the bestseller list.</p><p>\"Charles had written a book and he wanted it high in the list,\" she said. \"He gave me £200 and when I was on my break all afternoon I went in a taxi from east London to west London to buy books.\" She said she had made such buying trips four times a week.</p><p>While she visited bookshops, said Grillo, the other PAs were instructed to buy Saatchi's book on Amazon using the cards he had issued to them.</p><p>The case continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424915809|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|9ee531c76037c544f1c10b62e5174d8361df8376 -->",

It has to be the ending, when – as host Jonathan Ross, who was bizarrely competing with himself on ITV by the end, later tweeted – Channel 4 were \"fucking idiots for cutting [outstanding achievement winner] Steve Coogan's speech off for a REPEAT of Gogglebox\". But there were plenty of drunken highlights too, particularly Johnny Vegas's rambling tribute to Paul Whitehouse, which included barbed comments about Ricky Gervais's The Office. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/johnny-vegascriticizes-ricky-gervais-sitcom-2921628\" title=\"\">The Mirror reports</a> that he said: \"Paul's comedy, compared to other people [he then mumbled \"The Office\"], it doesn't make victims of anything. And it doesn't claim that it's getting over boundaries. Paul Whitehouse finds the joy and beauty in life and people you wouldn't notice because they'd walk past you at a bus stop.\" He later added: \"Tonight is not about slagging off the sponsors or giving an international award away to someone just because he was here [Will Ferrell]. It is not about the state of TV and the fact you won't commission anything fresh ... There are people in this room that we don't admire, that we don't think should have won. There is is stuff which has been pushed through because of finance and Channel 4 feeling like the little brother compared to the BBC, but tonight is about Paul Whitehouse.\" Meanwhile, David Mitchell criticised the definition of best comedy entertainment personality, the prize he was co-presenting, at donnish length, and was then kissed on the lips by the winner, Alan Carr. The League of Gentlemen introduced the best sitcom nominees with the barbed words \"what you must remember is no one sets out to make a pile of shit\" (presumably not aimed at the winner, Getting On, so Count Arthur Strong and Bad Education must be in the frame). And someone, possibly king of comedy winner Jack Whitehall, said: \"I won't thank the public – I hate the public\", but by that time the effects of toasting the winners were beginning to overwhelm Monkey.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424891111|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|05c96853c3a0e111e4673a533e0c64ee9f05b02b -->",

        "headline":"Eddie Izzard on going into politics: 'Why shouldn't I be mayor of London?'",
        "body":"<p>When Neil Kinnock bounds up after&nbsp;the football to say hello, I want to throw my arms around him and kiss his beaming face. He has just watched his Cardiff team lose to Eddie Izzard's beloved Crystal Palace, but anyone watching the two men would think it was the other way round, for the&nbsp;comedian still looks as blankly distant as&nbsp;he has all day.</p><p>At first I'd put Izzard's humourless demeanour down to pre-match nerves. A lifelong Palace fan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/16/eddie-izzard-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">he became an associate director of the club last year</a>, so we meet for lunch at the ground before the game. By the time post-match drinks arrive, five hours later, I&nbsp;have to conclude that while I had been very much looking forward to our meeting, he evidently hadn't. Then up bounces the former Labour leader. It's a&nbsp;relief just to see a friendly, smiling face – but all the more so when it turns out that even with Kinnock, one of his all-time heroes, Izzard remains detached. Nothing seems to defrost the comedian, which makes me feel better about the whole strangely tense day – but even more confused about Izzard.</p><p>Now 51, he has been widely adored for more than two decades. His fans worship his surreal, Pythonesque humour, and few were put off when he came out in the 90s as a heterosexual transvestite, and began cross-dressing on stage. Everyone else fell in love with him in 2009, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/15/eddie-izzard-charity-run\" title=\"\">he ran 43 marathons in 52 days for Sport Relief</a>. This year he performed the biggest-ever global standup tour, selling out from South Africa to Zagreb with a routine covering everything from human sacrifice to Olympic dressage, and the DVD – <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z68v2hU9vJA\" title=\"\">Force Majeure</a> – has been enthusiastically reviewed. His childhood ambition to be an actor has come true, with roles in Ocean's Twelve, The Avengers and other films. Most impressively of all, the French leg of his Force Majeure tour was performed entirely in French. Izzard is now studying German, and once he's pulled off a performance in that, too, he'll move on to Spanish, then Russian.</p><p>So why make such heavy weather of an afternoon at the football? It starts with an innocent question about if it's harder to be funny in a foreign language. \"No, the difficult thing to learn is how to have a sense of humour. Language is not difficult to learn.\" But even when I used to be pretty much bilingual, I say, I still wasn't very funny in French. He studies me doubtfully. \"Well were you – are you – funny in English?\" Funnier than in French, definitely.</p><p>\"Well, you didn't try it. I mean, I&nbsp;made a guy laugh in a traffic jam at the&nbsp;Cannes film festival. We were going along at nought miles per hour. Then after about 20 minutes we went up to 5mph. So I said, 'Wow – c'est comme le Grand Prix maintenant.'\" I ask what he'd have said to the driver had they been in England. \"Er, probably, 'It's like Brands Hatch now.'\" I think that's a bit funnier. \"No, not in France.\" But that's my point&nbsp;– surely humour often lies in the specificity of a particular reference? \"Look, it doesn't really matter,\" he says&nbsp;curtly. \"I do universal humour.\" Eventually, he says, he will learn Arabic, too. \"I was born in Yemen, so it's my duty to do this when Arab people are struggling so hard to try to get democracy going. I have to play Yemen. This is right that I should be doing this.\"</p><p>By May 2019, however, Izzard intends to be winding up his showbusiness CV and launching a political career. \"Everybody says I would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2013/may/14/eddie-izzard-mayor-of-london\" title=\"\">a good fit for mayor</a>,\" he explains, \"because it's a&nbsp;personality-led thing,\" but if by then London has an incumbent Labour mayor, he'll run for parliament instead. Having helped Labour fight four general elections, and been cheerleader-in-chief for Ken Livingstone's 2012 mayoral campaign, he has a good idea of what he'd be getting himself into. \"But I have to do this in my life. I should stand up and be counted.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424918385'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386944708186/Alan-Johnson-left-and-Edd-009.jpg' alt='Alan Johnson (left) and Eddie Izzard on the general election campaign trail 2010' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Then home secretary Alan Johnson (left) and Eddie Izzard on the general election campaign trail in 2010. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</figcaption></figure><p>It's a laudable impulse, but while I&nbsp;was watching him wow Wembley on his new DVD, I found it quite hard to picture him planning local bus routes with a transport committee. I can't think of any precedent. \"There is in America,\" he snaps. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/02/in-praise-of-al-franken\" title=\"\">Al Franken</a>'s done it. Who I&nbsp;know well. I said to him, 'What you're doing is what I'm trying to do.' And he's already done it.\"</p><p>Franken's comedy was always political, though, and Izzard's emphatically isn't, so I try to get a sense of his beliefs. He joined the Labour party in 1995, and his politics sound like vintage New Labour: \"Safety net for people who are having a tough time, encourage wealth creation on the positive side.\" He hates extremism, and as a \"radical centrist\" thinks he has a&nbsp;unique political advantage.</p><p>\"You see, I've never heard anybody else talk about this, but I think I do know where the centre of an argument is. And I think that's an important thing. I've heard people arguing, and you think: actually, do you two realise you're&nbsp;fighting like crazy but you're actually saying the same thing? So I&nbsp;want to get involved. I do do things in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way.\"</p><p>I'm not sure that all political arguments can be squared so easily. Take the London riots, for example. According to the right, the rioters were greedy yobs; to the left, they were victims of a consumerist society. Where would Izzard locate the central consensus in that argument? \"It's probably somewhere in between them, isn't it?\" he retorts. \"No, I haven't analysed that. I&nbsp;wasn't mayor of London at the time. I&nbsp;haven't analysed exactly what was happening, no. When I get in, that's when I'll make my decisions.\"</p><p>He's oddly evasive about where he lives. He does own a flat in London, but rents it out, and says he stays in a hotel when he's in town. But where is all his stuff? He hesitates. \"Er. My stuff is in … places.\" Izzard has always refused to discuss private relationships, so may just be trying to avoid mentioning a girlfriend. But he goes on, \"I don't really need stuff. Some people want to amass stuff, but that's not really what I'm interested in.\"</p><p>He looks surprised when I ask why he wants to be mayor. \"Why? I think I can put a lot of energy into it. I was born in London, I think London's a great city. I&nbsp;think I can bring unusual things to the table, and think in a different way. And, ummm … I mean, why shouldn't I be?\" One reason could be that as a rich celebrity who spends a good deal of his time abroad, he doesn't face many of the daily issues most Londoners do. He looks annoyed, and too late I realise his question had been rhetorical.</p><p>\"But I have been through lots of people's experiences in London, when I&nbsp;was living and working in London. I&nbsp;have now created this comedy, which is my business, and exported it around the world. I cannot get it around the world without going there. I'm not making widgets, so actually, unfortunately, I have to take it around. I think it's a positive thing if someone like myself, who's openly, you know, out as a&nbsp;straight transvestite, who's played the Hollywood Bowl, played Madison Square Garden, who is touring around arenas doing gigs in French, German – I&nbsp;think that's pretty positive. So any kid – girl, boy, straight, gay, lesbian, doesn't matter – they could say, 'Well, that person did OK, by working their way up&nbsp;from the streets of London.'\"</p><p>It's hard to work out what he would actually want to do in office. If he could take his pick of Whitehall, which government department would he love to run? After 10 seconds of silence, \"I am not sure. That's a bit like asking me what my dream acting project would be. I&nbsp;don't think I quite work in that way.\" I'm just trying, I explain, to get a sense of his key priorities. \"Well, politically, I&nbsp;want myself to do well, and I want other people to do well.'\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424918386'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386944821535/Eddie-Izzard-as-he-comple-009.jpg' alt='Eddie Izzard as he completed the 40th of 43 marathons he ran in 52 days in 2009' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Eddie Izzard as he completed the 40th of 43 marathons he ran in 52 days in aid of Sport Relief in 2009. Photograph: Geoff Pugh/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p>Izzard describes himself as a \"glass two-thirds full\" optimist – \"You know, I'm a transvestite who's got this far, so you've got to be pretty positive\" – and his political approach as \"an open hand, where you say, 'Who are you? Hi. Can I&nbsp;shake your hand?'\" But although he is polite to everyone we meet all afternoon, I don't spot any conspicuous embrace of humanity. It's easier to see why he was drawn to the loneliness of long-distance running, and no great surprise to read that he once said, \"I&nbsp;don't really have friends.\" If he wants to be a politician, he'll need to learn how to look as though he's listening when people talk to him, instead of staring vacantly into space. I worry, too, about how he will cope with the hatred heaped upon every politician.</p><p>\"Well, how much hate,\" he flashes back, \"did I get for being a transvestite? It's very, very high. I've had things said to me that … \" and he breaks off, as if the insults are simply unrepeatable. Such as? He steels himself. \"Like: 'What the fuck is that?'\" – and fixes me with burning stare. \"You know, if I can deal with that, then I think politics is easy.\" It's not an entirely reassuring response.</p><p>Izzard has always described himself as a transgender heterosexual who favours a \"girl look\" when he's feeling in \"girl mode\", and a \"boy look\" when in \"boy mode\", saying of his genetic makeup, \"I just have an extra girlie bit, which surfaces with the heels, skirts and makeup.\" So I ask if he will campaign wearing women's clothes.</p><p>\"I don't wear women's clothes,\" he&nbsp;corrects sharply. \"Are women transvestites because they're wearing trousers? No. They just say they're wearing trousers. So I deny I'm wearing women's clothes. I just say I'm wearing clothes.\" How would he like me to refer to them? \"Just say, 'wearing dresses', or&nbsp;'wearing makeup'.\"</p><p>Would he campaign wearing a dress and makeup? \"I'll campaign with these nails,\" and he holds up a long, immaculately painted set, blood-red save for a union flag on one finger, and an EU flag on another. \"If I've got my nails painted then that's as much girl mode as anything.\" It may be to Izzard, but for many voters I'd guess that a male mayor in a dress is a different proposition to one with red nails. \"No, not really,\" he counters coldly. \"I'm saying that I will wear whatever I want to wear at whatever time. I don't know what you're trying to gauge there.\" He was the one who kept citing transvestism in the context of his future career, so I don't know why he minds me trying to establish what voters can expect. For several years he has referred to going through a \"blokey phase\", and I can't recall the last time I saw a picture of him in anything more adventurous than nail polish, mascara and heeled boots, so I&nbsp;ask when he last put on a dress. \"I'm not sure,\" he says, in a tone that makes it sound like, \"I'm not saying.\"</p><p>It takes a lot to walk away from global stardom and artistic freedom. To give it all up for the dreary discipline of politics is astonishing. I wonder how he'll cope with the relentless clamour for his undivided attention, or satisfy voters' need for a sense of personal connection. Izzard isn't worried at all.</p><p>\"I have always learned how to do things while struggling at the beginning to work out how they work. I started in sketch comedy, then I was a street performer, then I was a standup, then an&nbsp;actor, and I wasn't good at any of them at first. So I'll probably screw up. But I'll learn.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424910591|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|3631edbd3fb6c5c83f4c079d47d0919b93510ecf -->",

To mark the occasion, we asked readers to help nominate Will Ferrell's greatest performances to date. Here's our pick of the bunch – but are there any glaring omissions? Tell us you all-time favourites in the thread below.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/97508/elf\">1. Elf</a></h2> <p>&quot;Why has Elf become so beloved in such a short time?&quot; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/08/elf-recap-elfalong-will-ferrell\">wrote Stuart Heritage</a> last week. &quot;I think it might be because it manages to delicately walk a very narrow line. It's much harder than it looks to get the tonality of a Christmas film right … Elf is silly but tender. It's respectfully disrespectful. It's fleetingly sad, but it's incredibly funny. It is a Christmas miracle.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyCfRHumHU\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jyCfRHumHU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/107105/wedding.crashers\">2. Wedding Crashers</a></h2> <p>He is only on screen for a few minutes, but Ferrell nearly steals the film as wedding crashing doyen and obnoxious man-child Chazz Reinhold.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZWfDtNRvA4\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZWfDtNRvA4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/117620/blades.of.glory\">3. Blades of Glory</a></h2> <p>Ferrell is the fiery yin to Jon Heder's uptight yang – and the pair make a great comedy double-act as ice skating rivals-turned-teammates.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqvTaYLP8yc\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqvTaYLP8yc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115237/stranger.than.fiction\">4. Stranger Than Fiction</a></h2> <p>A comparatively straight role for Ferrell in a postmodern tale of a tax accountant who starts to hear his entire life being narrated by a novelist.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpg8VII7es\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZpg8VII7es?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/106561\">5. Kicking &amp; Screaming</a></h2> <p>Whether you're a Ferrell fan or not, it can't be denied that he's got &quot;obnoxious&quot; performances down pat. In this Mighty Ducks-esque sports comedy he's a mild-mannered vitamin salesman who becomes a hyper-competitive team coach after a few cups of coffee.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAF6B3USip0\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAF6B3USip0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424836346|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|9dedc5b9bc141c0d81a08b7259664b7303d13875 -->",

        "body":"<p>Manchester United's Robin van Persie has been ruled out for a month with a thigh injury, according to the manager, David Moyes.</p><p>Van Persie suffered the injury taking a corner during the 1-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday. \"Robin has picked up a thigh strain and will be out for a month. He took the corner we scored the goal from against Shakhtar and felt his thigh,\" Moyes said.</p><p>The Dutchman's absence represents a blow to the champions as Moyes tries to turn around the dismal league form that has seen them lose the last two games and has left United 13 points behind Arsenal and seven off a Champions League place.</p><p>Moyes added: \"It is unfortunate because I think if you look at our record with Wayne Rooney and Robin in the team it is actually very good and we have not had them for quite a period recently.</p><p>\"Marouane Fellaini has a bit of a back injury. Michael Carrick is missing and Robin is going to miss four weeks with a thigh strain. That is a big blow to us.\"</p><p>With Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra and Chris Smalling also sidelined for the Shakhtar game, and his side suffering back-to-back Premier League defeats against Everton and Newcastle, it must feel as though Moyes is having no luck at present.</p><p>However, he said: \"I have no doubt it will get better. I am sure we have plenty of players who can cover it and we don't miss them too much.\"</p><p>In midfield his squad has been left bereft by the absence of Michael Carrick, who has been sidelined for a month with an Achilles injury. As Moyes had already identified central midfield as a problem area when he took over last July, it has merely exacerbated a situation that will become priority number one during next month's transfer window.</p><p>\"I do (feel United have felt Carrick's loss),\" said Moyes \"We need him for his creativity. We have missed him for lots of other reasons as well. It is important. We were looking for a couple of midfield players in the summer. We weren't able to get two. We got one.</p><p>\"We needed one who could give us something else if we did get an injury to Michael or one who could have played with him. We have definitely been a little bit short in that area. Hopefully he is not too far away and he will be back in a couple of weeks.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424916492|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|63c97b30d031e248f24e63c14b561f7f320b1397 -->",

        "headline":"Mandela memorial interpreter 'faced murder charge'",
        "body":"<p>The South African government has said it is aware of reports that the bogus sign language interpreter at Nelson Mandela's memorial once faced a murder charge, and he is being investigated.</p><p>Phumla Williams of the government communications office said the government was investigating Thamsanqa Jantjie and how he was selected to interpret at a memorial on Tuesday at which he stood close to the US president, Barack Obama, and other leaders.</p><p>\"We will come back and give a full report,\" Williams said of questions surrounding Jantjie. She said she and other officials were currently focusing on mourning events, which have included three days of public viewing of Mandela's casket and will end with the anti-apartheid leader's burial on Sunday.</p><p>Jantjie outraged deaf people by making signs they said amounted to gibberish. A South African TV news outlet, eNCA, reported that Jantjie faced a murder charge a decade ago, but it is unclear if the case was concluded. He also reportedly faced other criminal charges.</p><p>Asked by an Associated Press reporter about a murder charge, Jantjie turned and walked away without commenting.</p><p>The US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said \"we're all very upset\" about the bogus interpreter, who appeared just three feet from Obama at the memorial ceremony for Mandela, who died in his Johannesburg home on 5 December.</p><p>Thomas-Greenfield told reporters in Kenya on Friday that US officials were concerned about security and how the interpreter could have got so close to a number of world leaders.</p><p>South Africa's arts and culture minister, Paul Mashatile, apologised for the use of Jantjie and said reforms must be implemented to ensure such an incident would not happen again.</p><p>\"Without passing judgment, nobody should be allowed to undermine our languages. We sincerely apologise to the deaf community and to all South Africans for any offence that may have been suffered,\" Mashatile said in a statement.</p><p>He did not comment on who was responsible for hiring the sign interpreter for Tuesday's memorial. Several government departments involved in preparations for Tuesday's memorial have denied hiring Jantjie. The African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, said the state was responsible for all arrangements.</p><p>Jantjie told Associated Press on Thursday he had been violent in the past and hallucinated during the memorial service as he was gesturing incoherently.</p><p>Thomas-Greenfield also said officials are dismayed because the people who need sign language were not able to understand what was said at the ceremony. She called the problem \"extraordinarily sad\".</p><p>In Washington, the secret service spokesman Ed Donovan said on Thursday that vetting for criminal history and other appropriate background checks of the people onstage were the responsibility of the South Africans. He added that secret service agents were \"always in close proximity to the president\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424923764|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|e69d80c3b29837d9bf8ce170ae1744d13e1f692e -->",

It's probably not long before that underwhelming banter generator, That Internet, proclaims him as the David Moyes <em>de nos jours</em>, especially as across the park Roberto Martínez cracked the code <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/04/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">of winning big on the road</a>, at Manchester United, not long after taking over. Rodgers should be cut a little slack, though. It's not as though he sends his team on to the pitch with a negative mind-set: there have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/30/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league\" title=\"\">2-2 draws at Arsenal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/03/manchester-city-liverpool-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City</a>, plus <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/23/everton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a 3-3 at Everton</a>. And on other days, results could have been much more positive, had Jordan Henderson, Joe Allen and Pepe Reina not flown into flat spins at various inopportune moments (at Old Trafford, Goodison and the Etihad). The thin line between success and failure in professional sport, huh? Having said that, Rodgers needs to register a big win on his travels soon, or this could develop into a complex. Liverpool have an appalling record at White Hart Lane but Tottenham's current uncertainties offer him an opportunity. If not now, then Chelsea and Manchester City come in quick succession. Fail to win any of those – a prospect that's hardly a faint one – and Liverpool have themselves a little mental problem brewing. <strong>Scott Murray</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/10/steven-gerrard-liverpool-injury-four-weeks\" title=\"\">Gerrard hopes to return from injury in four weeks</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>2) Arsenal look for positive end to tricky week</h2><p></p><p>Arsenal have a mental balancing act to perform this weekend, too. Their surprisingly weak performance during the second half at Napoli <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/12/arsene-wenger-arsenal-napoli-champions-league\" title=\"\">has filled Arsène Wenger with \"regret\"</a>, his team now facing the possibility of another brutal second-round draw in the Champions League, and with it another relatively early European exit at the hands of one of the game's giants. While that has no literal bearing on Arsenal's season until February, the dull thud of regret could nag away like toothache, and they can't afford to follow up a league game in which points were squandered late on against Everton with defeat at Manchester City, especially as difficult encounters with Chelsea and Newcastle are coming soon after. The weird thing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/11/napoli-arsenal-champions-league\" title=\"\">about the Napoli result</a> was that Arsenal were in total control defensively in the first 45 minutes, against one of Europe's more potent teams. Two halves of that  at the Etihad at Saturday lunchtime and Arsenal will have escaped from a tricky week still in fine fettle at the top of the Premier League table. Another one-half showing and City will suddenly be only three points behind them – and Arsenal have themselves a little mental problem brewing. <strong>SM</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/12/arsenal-mikel-arteta-manchester-city-scheduling\" title=\"\">Arteta rails against scheduling before Man City clash</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/12/arsene-wenger-arsenal-napoli-champions-league\" title=\"\">Wenger admits 'regret' after Arsenal defeat at Napoli</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/12/arsenal-investigation-fans-travel-delays-napoli-champions-league\" title=\"\">Arsenal launch investigation into fans' travel delays</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>3) It's the banker of the week/season!</h2><p></p><p>Manchester United already have a little mental problem brewing, albeit only domestically. (Dodgy in the Premier League, majestic in Europe, are United on an erratic caper <em>à la</em> Liverpool 2005 or Chelsea 2012?) After back-to-back defeats at home, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/04/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">first to 1990s throwbacks Everton</a> then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/07/manchester-united-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Newcastle from out of the 1970s</a>, David Moyes is desperate for a big result to maintain United's faint hopes of retaining their title. Oh look! The bus is pulling up at Villa Park! Since losing the Alan Hansen Headstone Inscription Match in 1996, United have travelled to play Aston Villa at their gaff 17 times in the league. They've won 11 of those mismatches, and drawn the other six. Throw in three cup victories too, and United couldn't pick a bigger banker to get back on the horse. In a purely logical world, history wouldn't weigh this heavily, but it does, evidently so on Villa. The home side's only hope might be that United, always comfortable in this arena, push forward with such swash and buckle that Villa's pacy front line spring them on the break. Their two best results this season – at home to Manchester City, and away at Southampton – has seen the game pan out pretty much like that. But 17 years of misery suggests it's a long shot. Still, if Everton and Newcastle can buck big trends … <strong>SM</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/11/manchester-united-ashley-young-referees-diving\" title=\"\">Young realises he has a reputation for diving</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/11/david-moyes-manchester-united-passing-shakhtar-donetsk\" title=\"\">Moyes rips into United over passing against Shakhtar</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>4) Time for the Toon</h2><p></p><p>It might be time to start taking Newcastle United a wee bit more seriously. The form team in the division, they've won five out of their past six, including victories over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/02/newcastle-united-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Chelsea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/10/tottenham-hotspur-newcastle-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/07/manchester-united-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester United</a>. And yet they've still rather flown under the radar on their way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table\" title=\"\">up to seventh spot</a>. Their first victory at Old Trafford since 1972, for example, ended up being more about the travails of David Moyes than the midfield excellence of Yohan Cabaye, Cheik Tioté and Moussa Sissoko. Cabaye and Tioté's nice-and-nasty act in the centre of the park grabs the lion's share of what little attention Newcastle are given, though Sissoko's arguably the man of the moment: witness his recent thriker against West Bromwich Albion, or last weekend's systematic undressing of France team-mate Patrice Evra. Southampton will test Newcastle thoroughly at St James' Park on Saturday in their trademark intense style – the absence of the suspended Cabaye will help the visitors there – but with Saints stuttering this is the sort of fixture the Toon should be winning if they're to challenge for a European place. An outside shout for the Champions League? With a midfield like theirs, why not? <strong>SM</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table\" title=\"\">Latest Premier League table and statistics</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>5) Are Stoke leaving the Pulis years behind?</h2><p></p><p>Stoke City started the month of November by scoring a goal that was their former manager in distilled form, a tincture of Tony, a <em>parfum de Pulis</em>: that route-one-to-the-power-of-one upfield blooter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/premier-league-stoke-city-southampton\" title=\"\">by goalkeeper Asmir Begovic</a> against Southampton. But at Swansea the week after, things started getting interesting. Stoke's second goal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/10/swansea-city-stoke-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">in a 3-3 draw</a> was the result of some tiki-taka triangulation down the inside-right channel which culminated in Stephen Ireland stroking a finish into the bottom left in a Messi stylee. Having out-Swansea'd Swansea, it was the first suggestion that Mark Hughes was beginning to impose a new style on his new charges. A month down the line, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/07/stoke-city-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Stoke have seen off Chelsea</a>, Oussama Assaidi adding to Stoke's prettied-up portfolio. A visit to Hull at Saturday teatime gives them an opportunity to firmly establish themselves in mid-table, from where Hughes can continue his fine work in peace. But which Stoke will turn up? The one which has scored eight goals in three recent games against Manchester United, Swansea and Chelsea, or – here's Steve Bruce hoping – the one that shipped four at Everton? <strong>SM</strong></p><p></p><h2>6) Sunderland's time for festive push</h2><p></p><p>This time last season Sunderland were about to endure a harrowing festive period, featuring defeats to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/05/sunderland-manchester-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">Manchester United</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/29/sunderland-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/07/sunderland-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Spurs</a> (as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/10/sunderland-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">their annual victory over Manchester City</a>, of course). They will need a much happier Christmas this year. The good news is that the fixture list comes wrapped in tinsel, with six of their next eight matches against teams in the bottom half. The bad news is that Sunderland have scrounged just one point from teams in the bottom half so far this season. They will hardly get a better chance to improve on that record than the one they have this Saturday, when they travel to depleted, deteriorating West Ham. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p><p></p><h2>7) Will Fulham repeat Villa heroics?</h2><p></p><p>It probably has not escaped the attention of the chairmen of, say, West Ham and Cardiff, that the three teams who have changed manager already this season have all improved. Granted, each of them is still in the relegation zone but they seem to have upward momentum and plans that are taking root. How long that lasts remains to be seen, of course. It will be especially interesting to see whether Fulham can repeat the performance that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/08/fulham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">swept them to victory against Aston Villa last weekend</a>, since it was totally at odds with most of what they had done previously this season. René Meulensteen has made a couple of personnel changes and imposed a more coherent shape but the biggest transformation was in the side's attitude and energy levels, as exemplified by Dimitar Berbatov's most dynamic display of the season. If they can reproduce that at Goodison Park, then Fulham can be confident of clambering free of danger. And other clubs may decide it is time to reinvigorate their team with a new manager too. <strong>PD</strong></p><p></p><h2>8) Swans' need for Michu to step up</h2><p></p><p>Last season's sensation is becoming a frustration. Michu scored 18 league goals in his debut season in England and was supposed to be even more influential this term. Swansea splashed £8.5m on a specialist centre-forward, Wilfried Bony, so that Michu could spend more time in his favourite position, in the hole behind. But it hasn't quite worked out so far. He and his team-mates often appear on different wavelengths, his runs too often disorienting Swansea rather than unhinging opponents. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/09/swansea-hull-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Against Hull on Monday</a>, when he returned from an injury-enforced absence, he was deployed again as a lone striker due to Bony's absence and it was a vexing experience all round: he was visibly exasperated at his team-mates' inability to find him amid three Hull centre-backs and his team-mates seemed irked by the fact when they did deliver the ball into a dangerous area, Michu had usually drifted off somewhere else. Ultimately, he extended his goalless streak to six matches. With Bony fit again and Alejandro Pozuelo emerging as a classy menace, some Swansea fans are starting to call for Michu to be dropped. Norwich, you suspect, would welcome that. <strong>PD</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/12/st-gallen-swansea-city-europa-league\" title=\"\">Swansea safely through to Europa League last 32</a></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>9) Six-shooters must provide more firepower</h2><p></p><p>Shane Long, Saido Berahino, Markus Rosenberg and the summer signings Nicolas Anelka, Victor Anichebe and Matej Vedra. In total, West Bromwich Albion's six strikers have scored league six goals this season. Steve Clarke seems to waver between which ones he likes best, as only Long has started more than half of the club's league matches (eight out of 15). How the manager must miss Romelu Lukaku. He probably feels less nostalgic about Peter Odemwingie but at Cardiff on Saturday the Nigerian will be aiming to strengthen the belief that this summer's transfer activity left the Baggies with less firepower rather than more. After just one league goal from Odemwingie so far this season and none from anyone in the past three matches, Cardiff could do with seeing some evidence of that too. <strong>PD</strong></p><p></p><h2>10) Palace seek Chelsea upset</h2><p></p><p>Sometimes it feels as if José Mourinho is just an upmarket Tony Pulis. But not at the moment because the one thing that both managers insist on having is absent at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea do not have a solid spine and that it why their form is erratic and Mourinho has not yet looked truly at home since his return. Chelsea do not currently have a reliable striker or a dominant midfield anchor and, in recent weeks, Petr Cech has contracted the wobbles in goal. Palace, who have developed a sturdy backbone over the past five matches, will go to the Bridge feeling there is a brittleness there that they just might be able to exploit. <strong>PD</strong></p><p></p><p><blockquote>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/12/barry-bannan-crystal-palace-chelsea-aston-villa\" title=\"\">Big interview with Crystal Palace's Barry Bannan</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/11/chelsea-st-etienne-kurt-zouma\" title=\"\">Chelsea weigh up £13m January bid for Zouma</a></blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424855591|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|f182c7428ba438d257075fe5716a6ed03097b0fe -->",

        "body":"<p>A failing free school is to close and have its funding terminated, the Department for Education has announced, making it the first casualty of the government's controversial free schools programme.</p><p>Discovery New School, a primary school in Crawley, West Sussex, is to be closed after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/19/free-school-fails-ofsted-gove\" title=\"\">Ofsted inspectors rated it as inadequate</a> and placed it in special measures, and subsequent attempts to revive the school were judged to be unfit and over-optimistic.</p><p>The decision was announced in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-from-lord-nash-to-chris-cook-discovery-new-school\" title=\"\">a letter from John Nash</a>, the government's schools minister in the House of Lords, to the head of the school.</p><p>\"I recognise that my decision to terminate the [funding agreement] is likely to be disappointing for pupils, parents and those involved with the school, but I will not allow a failing school to continue with no clear, workable plan to improve rapidly. It is not in the best interests of pupils to remain in an inadequate school,\" Nash wrote.</p><p>Discovery was in the first wave of 24 free schools to be approved, and opened in September 2011. According to <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/establishment/summary.xhtml?urn=137326&amp;myListCount=0\" title=\"\">Department for Education figures</a> the school had 65 pupils earlier this year, but a number are understood to have left since the Ofsted judgment in May questioned the school's performance.</p><p>The school will be closed in April next year, at the end of the spring term, with its remaining students to be offered alternative places by the local authority, West Sussex county council.</p><p>A DfE spokesperson said: \"The vast majority of free schools are performing well with three-quarters rated good or outstanding. But we will not hesitate to intervene and take swift action if children are being denied the education they deserve. This applies to every school.</p><p>\"Since the school was placed in special measures by Ofsted in May we have monitored progress closely. The [Discovery New School Academy Trust] has not provided evidence they are making the changes required. Lord Nash has today notified the trust that the department will terminate its funding agreement at the end of the spring term.\"</p><p>The school's headteacher Lindsey Snowdon, who co-founded the school with her husband Andrew, <a href=\"www.thisissussex.co.uk/Head-resigns-failing-school-s-improvement-plan/story-19935720-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">resigned in October</a> after a follow-up Ofsted inspection failed to find any improvement and reported: \"It is essential that a credible professional is appointed to the headship without delay.\"</p><p>Whitehall officials have always said that the DfE was prepared to close free schools that failed to attract parents or were badly managed. But the negative effect on pupils forced to change schools mid-year remains an unavoidable consequence of such a policy.</p><p>On the day the Discovery New School opened, Gove said: \"These schools are opening because of demand from parents for a new or different type of education. Free schools offer a genuine alternative. They offer smaller class sizes, longer hours and higher standards.\"</p><p>The letter from Nash argued that the school's leadership and governors were unable to repair the problems that had been identified.</p><p>\"We know from inspection evidence that teaching and learning is inadequate in DNS, and that there has been little or no improvement since Ofsted's judgement that the school required special measures in May,\" Nash wrote.</p><p>\"The number and nature of the actions and milestones to be achieved demonstrates that the staff are currently unable to deliver teaching and learning even at the most basic level with the consequence for the pupils of continued inadequate teaching for an unacceptable length of time.</p><p>\"Further, the training implication for staff is enormous. It is difficult to see how they would be able to attend all the training listed and at the same time provide adequate teaching for the pupils.\"</p><p>Discovery's closure follows the recent decision by the DfE to replace the leadership of the troubled Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which remains under threat of closure.</p><p>Separately, the DfE announced that it had rejected an attempt to open two new grammar schools in Kent.</p><p>\"Neither of the proposals which were put to us complied with the law. We will of course look closely at any further applications to expand schools into Sevenoaks. The two schools whose applications were unsuccessful are free to revise their plans and re-submit them,\" the DfE said.</p><p>DfE rules are that only funding for new academies or free schools can be approved.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424922387|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|c18a150fef3ff78707700a91601756832fe2b406 -->",

        "headline":"Britain will pay the price for shafting the working class",
        "body":"<p>Of the attributes Britons hold dear, the most potent is stability. Our traditions endure, institutions survive. We seem loth to countenance revolution. And yet we have experienced a coup d'etat of sorts and the question must be asked: just when did the middle classes take untrammelled control of the levers? It always was a force; but now there is hegemony. Today, a glimpse of what has happened to the vanquished.</p><p>According to the conservative <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/reforming-public-appointments\" title=\"\">thinktank Policy Exchange</a>, the under-representation of people from working-class backgrounds in public spheres such as parliament and magistrates courts can be reasonably described as shameful. It suggests an inquiry is necessary, perhaps run by the government equalities office and the equality and human rights commission. One can disagree with its diagnosis of the problem. Policy Exchange, true to its leaning, says the diversity policies of the last Labour government were too narrow – too much focus on race and gender – but that feels like scratching at the surface. Still, who can dispute that the problem exists?</p><p>One can look to the figures. <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/public/documents/1leading-people-report-6-.pdf\" title=\"\">According to the Sutton Trust thinktank</a> – which focuses on social mobility – 68% of \"leading public servants\" went to private schools. It says 63% of leading lawyers were privately educated, as were 60% of the upper ranks of the armed forces. Independent schools produce more than half of the nation's leading journalists, diplomats, financiers and business people. Policy Exchange says just 4% of MPs previously worked in manual trades.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I spoke to a would-be Labour councillor: a busy man; a professional. So busy that he thought the task of actually campaigning to get himself elected might be too time-consuming. So he placed an advert online seeking someone to do his campaigning for him. The powers that be took a dim view and the ad was promptly withdrawn, but I took to wondering what the councillors I knew in Newham in London, where I grew up and was a cub reporter, would have thought of him.</p><p>These were people who had graduated to the council having been shop stewards and tenants' association leaders. Charlie, the taxi driver; Lew, the tube driver; Jim, the car plant worker. Sue, the diffident single mother who galvanised the residents in one tower block and then another and then built a campaign that culminated in a clutch of dangerous tower blocks being demolished. There were working-class people in representative positions, voicing the concerns of people from their communities. Fewer now. What happened?</p><p>Thatcherism happened. The social geographer Danny Dorling details how the grocer's daughter from Grantham fractured the post-war reality of the poor becoming less poor and the narrowing of the gap between the very poor and very rich. \"By the time Thatcher left office in 1990, the annual incomes of the richest 0.01% of society had climbed to 70 times the national mean.\" For them to win, as they did under Thatcher and New Labour, others had to lose. Those who lost most were working-class communities.</p><p>With their institutions unravelled and a daily battle for subsistence, how are they to seek office in meaningful numbers? With what support? There are excellent groups building capacity, such as <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/\" title=\"\">Citizens UK</a>, but still the fundamental problem remains. Dorling recently estimated that of the bottom 50% of people in Britain by income <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/media/2013/05/different-class\" title=\"\">\"all are financially insecure\"</a>. How is that a springboard?</p><p>The total capture of the professions by the middle classes happened. Take journalism. I entered national journalism 27 years ago with no degree – just a year's college training, funded by a council grant, and after an apprenticeship on the Newham Recorder. That was when journalism was a trade, not a profession, and there were routes of entry for other than the middle classes. People took those routes to senior positions in our industry. With the middle class self-selecting, we wouldn't stand a chance today.</p><p>The country ticks along, stable and first-world prosperous. So why does the absence of working-class representation matter? Because it conflicts with everything we say we want for Britain: inclusion, fairness, equality of opportunity. Because without the broadest input, our institutions become myopic; our democracy atrophies. Isn't that the story of the last 30 years?</p><p><em>Twitter:  </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p><p></p><p>• This article was amended on 13 December 2013.

PirateBrowser will not only make&nbsp;domains \"irrelevant\" but will protect itself from future legal persecution.</p> <p>A source said: \"They should wait for our new PirateBrowser, then domains will be irrelevant.</p> <p>&ldquo;Once that is available then all links and sites will be accessible through a perfectly legal piece of browser software and the rest of it will be P2P, with no central point to attack via the legal system.&rdquo;</p> <p>\"By their actions they finally brought on the next generation of decentralized services.\"</p> <p>It is understood that the PirateBrowser will use the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/05/tor-beginners-guide-nsa-browser\">Tor network</a>&nbsp;as a way of allowing their users to access websites that are currently censored. It will appear as a standalone browser but users will also be able install plugins in Firefox and Chrome.</p> <p>The new BitTorrent-powered browser will also remove the requirement of a public-facing website and sites will instead take on a decentralised form.</p> <p>The Pirate Bay has found itself under multiple legal battles in the past, with their hardware also having been confiscated but last November they announced&nbsp;that they <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.pe/blog/224\">moved all of their data to the cloud</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The co-founder of Pirate Bay, Peter Sunde, also plans on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/10/pirate-bay-hemlis-encrypted-messaging-app-encrypt\">releasing an encypted messaging app</a> for Android and Apple devices.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Not entirely clued up on the Tor network? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/05/tor-beginners-guide-nsa-browser\">Here's our handy guide</a></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424893552|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|3bd894256fdb09e06be2a765cb9c5a914fe019ef -->",

        "headline":"Sadly, Rob Ford epitomises what Canada has become",
        "body":"<p>Pope Francis might be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/time-magazine-person-of-the-year-pope-francis\" title=\"\">Time magazine's person of the year</a>, but for Canada, there can be little doubt who our main noisemaker has been. Toronto's mayor, Rob Ford, with his acknowledgments of crack smoking, drunken stupors, driving while under the influence and socialising with drug dealers, has made Canadians cringe in an unexpected way.</p><p>Consider that Canadians view much of the world through American media, which places us in a very odd, existential state: we experience much of the world from the perspective of a country that barely knows we exist. When Canada does make the news, either as a Simpsons one-liner or a news story about some extreme weather, it sets off a collective frisson – a brief but thrilling sensation of being acknowledged.</p><p>Ford's ongoing fame is that much more agonising, given its epic scope. He has become one of the most famous Canadians in the world, attaining the kind of recognition usually only granted to one of our citizens once they have left the country, like William Shatner, Celine Dion or Justin Bieber.</p><p>But Ford's notoriety, which now includes the opening sketch for Saturday Night Live and a New Yorker cartoon, is horrifying to Canadians for another reason. It's the terror of recognition. Sadly but truly, Ford has become the very personification of what Canada has become.</p><p>This is difficult news for non-Canadians to digest. After all, many, if not most of you got your impression of Canada through Michael Moore's hugely popular documentaries: we are kind, gentle people who don't lock our doors at night, believe in universal healthcare and gun control and stayed out of the invasion of Iraq.</p><p>As some critics have pointed out, our prime minister, Stephen Harper, has remained remarkably silent on the Ford debacle. Harper needs the support of much of Ford's pugnacious voter base, many of who remain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/22/rob-ford-canada\" title=\"\">staunchly loyal</a> despite the snowballing scandals and gaffes. (Last week, in a TV interview that can only be described as ludicrously sycophantic, ex-con Conrad Black spoke to Ford, who <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-star-reporter-to-sue-rob-ford-for-libel/article15932345/\" title=\"\">insinuated that a reporter</a> covering his story might be a paedophile. The reporter has served him with a libel notice.) While different in their public demeanour, Harper and Ford are flip sides of the same hard-right coin.</p><p>And that makes the image of Ford all the more unsettling. What was once Canada the cool, the country a 1991 Economist cover story called the \"post-modern nation-state\", has now devolved into a rightwing hellhole. Ford was elected in 2010, one year prior to Canada's Conservative party winning a majority in the national parliament. Since then, Harper, a man who once referred to global warming as \"a socialist conspiracy\", has pushed Canada's policies sharply to the right.</p><p>Canada now has tough-on-crime legislation that includes strict minimum sentences – enacted despite the advice of some American Republican lawmakers, who pointed out that similar legislation south of the border has been expensive and ineffectual. Harper moved to dismantle the long-gun registry, which was brought in after a brutal 1989 mass shooting left 14 women dead at the hands of a deranged gunman. The registry was ended despite the pleas of victims-rights groups and police officers, who almost unanimously supported it.</p><p>But Canada's ideological reversal of fortune is perhaps most devastating when one considers environmental issues. Under the previous Liberal government, Canada had been one of the key architects of the Kyoto protocol; Harper's Conservatives officially withdrew Canada from the protocol, and instead are championing <a href=\"http://www.oilsands.alberta.ca/\" title=\"\">Alberta's tar sands</a>, a development many predict will have a catastrophic impact. In an announcement in November that was eclipsed by the Ford soap opera, the Washington, DC-based Center for Global Development ranked 27 countries in terms of their commitment to environmental protection. Canada came in 27th.</p><p>Adding to Canada's woes is the recent proposed legislation in Quebec – usually the most progressive province in the country – that would <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/15/us-quebec-analysis-idUSBRE98E07X20130915\" title=\"\">ban turbans, kippas and hijabs</a> from being worn by government workers. Quebec politicians insist the Values Charter, as it has come to be known, will unify citizens by enforcing secularism. But racial and religious minorities see the move as discriminatory and divisive.</p><p>Making this a bone-deep trauma is the fact that Harper's Conservatives won their majority with only 39% of the popular vote. The votes between our moderate party (the Liberals) and leftwing party (New Democrats) meant that the sanity vote was divided. It could be likened to the American presidential election of 2000, when Bush managed to win via the electoral college system, despite the fact that Gore won the popular vote.</p><p>Each time Ford appears in the media, it's another eerie reminder of what we've become: crude, swaggering, bungling, irrational and mendacious. We've reached that staggering moment in a brilliant horror film when our protagonist realises the truth: Rob Ford is the New Canada. He is us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424904252|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|d37270964a3ac996578b96ca4ef19e0cf3fbf287 -->",

        "headline":"Former FBI agent missing in Iran was working for the CIA – report",
        "body":"<p>A retired FBI agent missing for seven years after disappearing in Iran was on an unauthorized mission for the CIA, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/12/robert-levinson-iran-missing-cia-secret\">according to an explosive new report on Thursday</a>&nbsp;that contradicted the official explanation that he was on private business.</p> <p>A years-long investigation by the Associated Press alleged in extensive detail that Robert Levinson, who disappeared from an Iranian island resort in 2007, had been involved in an extraordinarily unusual intelligence operation initiated by three CIA analysts who did not officially have the power to launch such operations.</p> <p>It is unclear if Levinson, a father of seven children&nbsp;who would now be 65 years old, is still alive.</p> <p>The US government has repeatedly and publicly denied that Levinson was in Iran on behalf of any government agency. As recently as 26 November, the White House issued a statement acknowledging Levinson as one of the &ldquo;longest-held Americans in history&rdquo;, reiterating a commitment to bring him home, and imploring the aid of Iran.</p> <p>That statement, issued by White House press secretary Jay Carney, said Levinson went missing on &ldquo;a business trip&rdquo;. But in its report, the AP said that the US government paid $2.5m to Levinson&rsquo;s family to forestall a lawsuit that would have likely resulted in details of the arrangement between Levinson and the agency coming to light.</p> <p>The Associated Press said it established Levinson's CIA connections in 2010 but held off publication three times at the request of the government, evidently out of concern that Levinson&rsquo;s life would be placed in jeopardy. The AP explained in a statement that efforts to find Levinson have for years come up empty.</p> <p>&ldquo;In the absence of any solid information about Levinson&rsquo;s whereabouts, it has been impossible to judge whether publication would put him at risk,&rdquo; said AP vice-president and executive editor Kathleen Carroll, who called the publication of the piece a &ldquo;difficult decision&rdquo;. She added: \"With no more leads to follow, we have concluded that the importance of the story justifies publication.&rdquo;</p> <p>Christopher White, a CIA spokesman, neither confirmed nor denied Levinson's affiliation with the agency.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have no comment on any purported affiliation between Mr Levinson and the US government. The US government remains committed to bringing him home safely to his family.&rdquo;</p> <p>According to the Associated Press, Levinson was brought on to a contract by the CIA in 2006, owing to his expertise in tracking illicit funds after a 28-year career at the FBI and with the Drug Enforcement Agency. His contract was with CIA analysts, who are not authorized to conduct intelligence operations.</p> <p>Yet Levinson, who had been a private investigator since retiring from government work, preferred to gather intelligence, and did so in several Latin American countries for the CIA while being paid by a friend there, Anne Jablonski, evidently to conceal the extent of Levinson&rsquo;s intelligence work. Levinson told Jablonski in 2007 that he was investigating corruption in the Iranian government &ndash; information that could be valuable for the CIA &ndash; and would travel to the region to meet with a contact.</p> <p>On 8 March, he travelled to Kish Island, off the Iranian coast, to meet the contact, Dawud Salahuddin. Levinson checked out of a hotel the following day and disappeared.</p> <p>&ldquo;I have been held here for three and a half years. I am not in very good health,&rdquo; Levinson stated in his <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/01/levinson/\">only known proof-of-life video</a>, made in 2010 and reportedly traced to an internet cafe in Pakistan. &ldquo;I need the United States government to answer the requests of the group that has held me for three and a half years.&rdquo;</p> <p>According to the AP, the CIA initially and mistakenly told the FBI, Congress and the Bush administration that Levinson was not a CIA asset. Only when a friend of Levinson, former federal prosecutor David McGee, went through Levinson&rsquo;s communications and alerted the Senate intelligence committee did the abductee&rsquo;s relationship with the CIA become clearer.</p> <p>The AP reported that following an internal investigation, the CIA in 2008 pushed Jablonski, a colleague and their boss into early resignations and retirements, and internally disciplined seven others. It created stricter rules for analysts&rsquo; dealings with outsiders, reflecting the impact Levinson&rsquo;s case had &ndash; in secret.</p> <p>It is unclear if the CIA referred any criminal charges for those involved in the Levinson case&nbsp;to the Justice Department. The then CIA deputy director Stephen Kappes was tasked with explaining the extent of Levinson&rsquo;s involvement with the CIA in closed-door Senate hearings.</p> <p>Brian Weiss, a spokesman for Senate intelligence committee chairwoman, Dianne Feinstein, said there would be no statement on the Levinson case on Thursday.</p> <p>In response to the AP story, his family said the US could have done more to find him and bring him home.</p> <p>\"Bob is a courageous man who has dedicated himself, including risking his own life, in service to the US government.&nbsp;But the US government has failed to make saving this good man&rsquo;s life the priority it should be,\" the family said.</p> <p>\"There are those in the US government who have done their duty in their efforts to find Bob, but there are those who have not. It is time for the US government to step up and take care of one of its own. After nearly seven years, our family should not be struggling to get through each day without this wonderful, caring, man that we love so much.\"</p> <p>The AP explained that because investigators&rsquo; leads to Levinson had run dry, the public interest in revealing what it called the &ldquo;serious mistakes and improper actions&rdquo; that led to his disappearance compelled them to publish.</p> <p>National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden issued a statement criticizing the AP for publishing its story, but was similarly silent about Levinson's relationship with the CIA.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Without commenting on any purported affiliation between Mr Levinson and the US government, the White House and others in the US government strongly urged the AP not to run this story out of concern for Mr Levinson&rsquo;s life,\" she said. \"We regret that the AP would choose to run a story that does nothing to further the cause of bringing him home. The investigation into Mr Levinson&rsquo;s disappearance continues, and we all remain committed to finding him and bringing him home safely to his family.&rdquo;</p> <p>Tim Weiner, author of the acclaimed CIA history \"Legacy of Ashes,\" said Levinson's case was \"yet another&nbsp;case of carelessness at a cost of human life in the name of human intelligence.\"</p> <p>The CIA's congressional oversight committees did not have immediate comment</p> <p>Levinson&rsquo;s family have sent up a website, <a href=\"http://www.helpboblevinson.com/\">helpboblevinson.com, </a>to raise awareness. The website hosts the proof-of-life tape, in which Levinson implores the US government: &ldquo;Please help me get home. Thirty-three years of service to the United States deserves something.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/424869487|2013-12-13T17:52:07Z|305f1c920ea24fa82d1619661c66a281e41fd355 -->",
