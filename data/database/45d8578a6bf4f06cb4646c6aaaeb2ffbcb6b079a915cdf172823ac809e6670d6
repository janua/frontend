Indigenous people were left outside the process which led to the drafting of the Australian constitution, and the only references in the document were discriminatory.</p><p>She argues the preconditions are now there for a positive result, and much of the groundwork is already in place. “If we allow the issue to linger we might lose momentum,” she said on Friday. “I realise that in some respects it sounds ambitious, but this requires a sense of urgency.” </p><p>While the principle of recognition has multi-partisan support, Hosch argues it would be preferable to have Australians consider constitutional change outside the hothouse environment of a federal election. “This is a special conversation the nation needs to have. We wouldn’t want it to get lost in the context of a general election.”</p><p>A committee of the parliament led by two Indigenous MPs – the Liberal party’s Ken Wyatt and Labor senator Nova Peris – has been tasked with producing the specific wording for the change.</p><p>Hosch said the two MPs were “cognisant of what’s required” to produce wording that Indigenous people can support and non-Indigenous Australians endorse.</p><p>A successful referendum requires a double majority – a national yes vote and affirmation in the majority of the states. Of the country’s 44 referendums, only eight have succeeded. </p><p>Abbott has been a consistent supporter of recognising Indigenous people in the constitution. But the change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/andrew-bolt-v-tony-abbott-all-very-amiable-up-to-a-point\">does not have universal support</a> in conservative circles.</p><p>The attorney general, George Brandis, has previously endorsed a similar timeframe and approach to the one Hosch is now advocating. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/12/indigenous-recognition-tony-abbott-seeks-change-in-this-parliament-or-next\">opening of the new 44th parliament</a>, the prime minister gave himself room to manoeuvre on timing by saying he wanted to see change in this parliament “or the next”.</p><p>The Coalition’s election policy on the question said a reform proposal would be drafted within 12 months of taking office.<br></p>","headline":"Push intensifies for Indigenous recognition in constitution","trailText":"Indigenous leader calls for urgent reform on eve&nbsp;of Australia Day weekend, when the&nbsp;prime minister is&nbsp;expected&nbsp;to raise the&nbsp;issue&nbsp;","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m666","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390540974674/9ae22a0a-66e6-48e0-b0ed-cf37bbc2eee6-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390540974674/9ae22a0a-66e6-48e0-b0ed-cf37bbc2eee6-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427905452","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e1f7d9e4b065f7ddbb842f","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Katharine Murphy, deputy political editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031891","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T16:45:54+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/push-intensifies-indigenous-recognition-constitution","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/push-intensifies-indigenous-recognition-constitution","tags":[{"id":"world/indigenous-australians","webTitle":"Indigenous Australians","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indigenous-australians","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/indigenous-australians","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/indigenous-peoples","webTitle":"Indigenous peoples","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indigenous-peoples","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/indigenous-peoples","references":[]},{"id":"world/tony-abbott","webTitle":"Tony Abbott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tony-abbott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/tony-abbott","references":[]},{"id":"world/george-brandis","webTitle":"George Brandis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/george-brandis","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/george-brandis","references":[]},{"id":"world/coalition","webTitle":"Coalition","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/coalition","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/coalition","references":[]},{"id":"world/liberal-party","webTitle":"Liberal party","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/liberal-party","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/liberal-party","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Katharine Murphy","r2ContributorId":"55866","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/22/1369191235759/Katharine-Murphy1.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Katharine Murphy is deputy political editor for Guardian Australia.

In the second test, one sample of Chinese peaches contained 0.11mg/kg. In both tests Australian tinned peaches contained 0.018 mg/kg. Another six types of Chinese peaches were also below the limit for lead content.</p><p>Stone said imported tinned fruit was regularly used by major institutions. “They are under budgetary pressures. They go for the cheapest available.

Sampras was in the audience at the Rod Laver Arena, the first time he saw them play each other live.</p><p>\"I never thought about 13 grand slams, or 14 either,\" Nadal said. \"I need to keep playing great to win this title. Stan's serve is huge, and he is hitting the ball very hard. I will try to play the same as I did tonight. When I play with Roger, it's a very special feeling. We play a lot of times for important things in our career. He's a really great champion, and it's an honour to play him. We played some tough rallies in the first set, he was playing some very aggressive tennis. I think tonight I played my best tennis of the tournament. After missing last year, it is very emotional for me to be back on this court.\"</p><p>Nadal tried to downplay the effect of a blister on his left hand and it did not seem to inconvenience him unduly – at least not as much as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/22/rafael-nadal-defeats-grigor-dimitrov-australian-open\" title=\"\">his quarter-final win over Grigor Dimitrov</a>. \"Too much talk about the blister,\" he said. \"It is OK. It is the position of the blister, it is difficult to cover. Normal life, it is OK, but to play the best players in the world it is a challenge. I have a very tough opponent in Wawrinka. He's played some amazing tennis. He will come to the final with a lot of confidence.\"</p><p>At the beginning, this semi-final had the feel of a major prizefight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier-muhammad-ali-1971\" title=\"\">Nadal's Joe Frazier to Federer's Muhammad Ali</a>. And the crowd might have been divided down those lines, too, leaning towards Roger, as ever, perhaps 75-25, craving artistry and style over strength and doggedness. In the early exchanges, Federer's sharper ground strokes, with subtle changes in direction and weight, as well as his new-found eagerness to kill the point at the net at the earliest opportunity, kept Nadal on the back foot. Going into the match, Federer had won 135 of 178 net approaches, and Nadal was sometimes three metres behind the baseline when receiving, and not much further forward after serving, so wary was he of his opponent's aggression.</p><p>Nadal was the first to get into a spot of trouble, having to fight through deuce to hold in eight minutes for 2-2 after a quarter of an hour. Then a stinging cross-court return and a passing shot down the left flank that only Nadal could conjure gave him two break points in the seventh game. But he failed to handle the tricky wind inside the open-roofed arena and his last shot of the game was a shanked forehand that skewed into the seats.</p><p>It was Federer's turn to suffer in the breeze in the ninth game, as he double-faulted and netted to give Nadal his third break point, but hung on, and the Spaniard had to serve to stay in the set at 4-5 after 36 minutes. He held with an ace – as did Federer for a 6-5 lead. The pressure was back on Nadal – who held to force the tie-break, then won it, Federer's final forehand floating long.</p><p>However, after holding to 30 in the first game of the second set, Nadal needed his blister tended to – not a good sign. It did not matter. When Federer slapped a forehand wide in the sixth game, Nadal led 4-2 and comfort flooded his tennis, the pain of his wound forgotten. He closed out the set and his confidence rose appreciably.</p><p>It was Federer's turn to struggle, and he did not handle the challenge so well. The fightback never really took off, from an unpromising deficit, and, when he netted another backhand volley, he fell 2-1 behind in the third, with the end beckoning more quickly be the shot. He delayed the fall to break back at 2-2, but Nadal forced him wider and deeper, and Federer faced a mountain when serving to stay in the match at 3-5.</p><p>He went down in flames, of course, belting an ace and making one final charge at the net, only to be passed again for deuce. There was absolutely nothing he could do about Nadal's arrowed passing shot for a second match point and he was resigned, maybe even a little relieved, when the agony ended on the end of his concluding forehand, which sailed harmlessly over the baseline.</p>","headline":"Rafael Nadal ruthless in beating Roger Federer at Australian Open","trailText":"Rafael Nadal saw off Roger Federer in three hard-fought sets to book his place in the Australian Open final","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m69g","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562922282/Rafael-Nadal-of-Spain-cel-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562922282/Rafael-Nadal-of-Spain-cel-003.jpg","wordcount":"813","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427922130","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601035","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Kevin Mitchell at Melbourne Park","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031982","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:31:50Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/rafael-nadal-beats-roger-federer-australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/rafael-nadal-beats-roger-federer-australian-open","tags":[{"id":"sport/australian-open-2014","webTitle":"Australian Open 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/rafaelnadal","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/rafaelnadal","references":[]},{"id":"sport/roger-federer","webTitle":"Roger Federer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/roger-federer","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australian-open","webTitle":"Australian Open","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tennis","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevinmitchell","webTitle":"Kevin Mitchell","rcsId":"GNL042083","r2ContributorId":"15957","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/03/31/kevin_mitchell_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Mitchell is the tennis and boxing correspondent for the Guardian and Observer.

challenges to overcome in order to achieve the government’s emissions reduction goals at least cost to Australia”.</p><p>The business group contends the government needs to consider allowing access to international abatement options critical “for reducing the costs and risks of Australian emissions reduction ambitions”.</p><p>International emissions credits should be incorporated in the policy, and the AiG adds the government should be the purchaser of international carbon credits.</p><p>The emissions reduction fund proposed in Direct Action is focused on domestic abatement in order to meet Australia’s stated target of cutting pollution by 5% by 2020 – an approach business says is too expensive.</p><p>In another notable submission to the Senate inquiry, the Climate Change Authority – an independent advisory body which the Abbott government proposes to abolish as part of its climate policy overhaul – does not mince its words.</p><p>The authority’s chair, former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser, has previously argued the 5% target is insufficient to stave off the dangerous effects of climate change and he repeats that argument in his submission to the Senate inquiry.</p><p>Fraser says major political parties in Australia profess to accept climate science but produce policies falling short of the challenge. “For acceptance of the science to mean more than lip service, however, it has to be backed by policy measures commensurate with the challenges identified by climate scientists,” he says.</p><p>“Real acceptance of the science would be accompanied by concerted action now and into the future to reduce the risks of dangerous warming of the planet over the decades ahead,” he says.</p><p>Fraser argues in the submission that the global dimension of the climate challenge is not served by high per capita emitters like Australia “sitting on the sidelines, waiting for others to make the running”.</p><p>He backs the argument that international abatement options should be part of the policy mix and reasons that appropriate responses should include both market and non-market mechanisms.</p><p>Fraser says the authority has not studied Direct Action closely because it has been occupied with other priorities and much of the policy remains ambiguous. “Even the label ‘direct’ is not without ambiguity: the implication seems to be that ‘direct’ action is in some way superior to ‘indirect’ action but the dividing line can be blurred.”</p><p>“Is a price on carbon, for example, less direct [and less effective] than planting more trees?” Fraser asks.</p><p>He says it is entirely the new government’s prerogative to abolish agencies such as the authority. “That said, it is puzzling – particularly given the complexities and far-reaching ramifications of climate change – that any government should choose to deny itself access to informed and balanced advice from an independent body like the Climate Change Authority.”</p><p><b></b><br></p>","headline":"Australian Industry Group fails to back Coalition's Direct Action climate policy","trailText":"Australian Industry Group&nbsp;declines&nbsp;to say

Where people had freedom, they created markets, he said.</p> <p>While most governments around the world produced economic stimulus packages in response to the global financial crisis, Abbott strayed into partisan politics with some criticism of the former government&rsquo;s Keynesian tendencies.</p> <p>The prime minister said Labor had departed from the surplus maxim of the Howard years with spending that lingered beyond the crisis.</p> <p>&ldquo;The reason for the spending soon passed but the spending didn&rsquo;t stop because, when it comes to spending, governments can be like addicts in search of a fix,&rdquo; Abbott told the forum, arguing the policy under his Labor predecessors Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard was &ldquo;spend our way to prosperity&rdquo;.</p> <p>Australia, he declared, was &ldquo;under new management, and open for business&rdquo;.</p> <p>Abbott produced a shopping list of his policies for attendees at the World Economic Forum, using them as case studies of initiatives to boost &ldquo;growth, participation and productivity&rdquo;.</p> <p>He said Australia would use its presidency of the G20 to promote global growth. He declared he wanted &ldquo;respectful but robust discussion of each country&rsquo;s national plan&rdquo;.</p> <p>Abbott has used the preamble to his Davos visit to reflect negatively on international talkfests. On Thursday night he said he wanted the G20 meeting in Brisbane to produce a communique &ldquo;just three pages long explaining precisely how good intentions are being put into practice&rdquo;.</p> <p>The G20, he said, must focus on trade, and &ldquo;at the very least &hellip; renew its commitment against protectionism and in favour of freer markets&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;My hope is to have a really frank leaders-only discussion in Brisbane about the biggest issues we face, including digitalisation and its implications for tax, trade and global integration,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>He said the G20 would tackle taxation and the problem of business artificially generating profits to &ldquo;chase tax opportunities rather than market ones&rdquo;.</p> <p>Abbott said companies should pay tax in the countries where the revenue was earned, rather than profit shift.</p>","headline":"Tony Abbott urges world leaders to prioritise growth and free trade","trailText":"Australian prime minister uses keynote speech at Davos forum to burnish his new government's free market credentials","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m594","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390467476402/2e82bc3c-396e-4be1-88dd-951f03525ea0-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390467476402/2e82bc3c-396e-4be1-88dd-951f03525ea0-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427813453","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e0d42ae4b07eba157a7a8a","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Katharine Murphy, deputy political editor, Guardian Australia","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031241","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T09:02:55Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/tony-abbott-urges-world-leaders-to-prioritise-growth-and-free-trade","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/tony-abbott-urges-world-leaders-to-prioritise-growth-and-free-trade","tags":[{"id":"world/australia-economy","webTitle":"Australia economy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-economy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia-economy","references":[]},{"id":"world/tony-abbott","webTitle":"Tony Abbott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tony-abbott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/tony-abbott","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/australian-politics","webTitle":"Australian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos-2014","webTitle":"Davos 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos-2014","references":[]},{"id":"world/g20","webTitle":"G20","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/g20","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/g20","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/katharine-murphy","webTitle":"Katharine Murphy","r2ContributorId":"55866","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/22/1369191235759/Katharine-Murphy1.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Katharine Murphy is deputy political editor for Guardian Australia.

Security sources said a person driving past security vehicles threw a hand grenade in their direction.&nbsp;</p><p>In Giza, a large district on the outskirts of Cairo, a third explosion went off near a police station. There were no immediate reports of casualties. </p><p>The first blast occurred shortly after 6.30am, about half an hour after the closure of a nearby security checkpoint, according to Mahmoud Abdel Sattar, a 27-year-old sergeant on duty on the third floor&nbsp;of the building.<br><br>\"A big truck exploded outside the fence – it didn't get inside the [forecourt of the] security headquarters itself,\" Sattar said. \"After the explosion, a white private car with four passengers started&nbsp;shooting on the buildings as well.\"<br><br>Sattar was hit by falling masonry. \"There was gunfire between the two sides. Everyone started running and there were a lot of injuries.\"<br><br>The blast caused a large crater outside the building that quickly filled with water. An official at the scene said it was 4 metres deep.<br><br>The immediate aftermath was chaotic, said Abdelrahman Mohsen, a 27-year-old furniture maker who arrived on the scene shortly after the explosion, and helped to carry away the casualties.<br><br>\"I saw at least four bodies on the floor, and then we carried four more,\" said Mohsen, who could not confirm if the victims were dead. \"There were a lot of police conscripts going inside and trying to find&nbsp;their friends, and there was masonry falling down on them in front of the building.\"<br></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0d4e3904-90f1-4bea-83f2-234ead4f982d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390550836469/82288d7e-e0f0-477c-9799-5fbac703077c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A man carries an Egyptian police officer to an ambulance after the car bombing in central Cairo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A man carries an Egyptian police officer to an ambulance after the bombing.

On Friday however, he conceded that it was a poor decision, because of “the way it looks”.<br></p><p>“Had Craig said 'house lost', 'death' or anything, I would have been over there in a minute,” he told Fairfax Radio.<br></p><p>United Firefighters Union national secretary Peter Marshall accused Wells of “texting like a teenager” while volunteer firefighters battled to save homes.&nbsp;Marshall told Guardian Australia he found Wells’s actions “outrageous”, adding that the minister and firefighters had been briefed about the severity of the fire situation – the worst in the state since the Black Saturday fires – and the potential for loss of life and assets.</p><p>“For him to reduce his duties of ensuring firefighters’ safety and the community’s safety … to a system of text messaging so he can go to the tennis is so outrageous. I’m still having trouble coming to terms with it,” said Marshall.&nbsp;He said that an “extraordinary” number of firefighters called him to express their disgust, and Wells should resign.</p><p>“These people are the ones that actually put their own lives at risk,” he said. “He should've been Johnny on the spot. I’m not asking him to get involved [in] the fire fight.”<br></p><p>Firefighters have also reported that during that night a number of fire stations in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne were left unattended, as crews were moved up to assist with fires – including the Stokehouse fire at St Kilda – without replacement. The allegations were first raised on Friday morning on Melbourne’s 3AW radio station.<br></p><p>Marshall said usually the policy was for trucks to be moved up to stations if they had been empty for more than half an hour, but that at least two stations – Glen Waverley and Footscray – were unattended for about five hours on Friday night.<br></p><p>In a text message seen by Guardian Australia, a firefighter reports that on the Friday night “we moved up to 24 station for five hours and left 31 unattended for that period of time”. A subsequent text message said it was confirmed with senior command “on that night [fire stations] 31, 47, 2, 39, 32 all unattended as well as three acting commanders”.&nbsp;Those fire stations are in Glen Waverley, Footscray, West Melbourne, Port Melbourne and Caulfield South, respectively.</p><p>Entries in the Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB) log also show that there were empty stations. A line at 12:36am on Saturday morning reads: “FSCC: [Assistant chief fire officer] Mr Dalrymple has been advised no move ups and some stations will have no coverage.”<br></p><p>Marshall said there were nine new trucks available, which had been used to transport firefighters assisting people during the heatwave during the day, but no firefighters were recalled, suggesting there was a reluctance to pay overtime.<br></p><p>Numerous senior firefighters had contacted Marshall about the hole in coverage, he said, adding that such an event was unprecedented in his career.<br></p><p>Deputy chief fire officer of the MFB, David Youssef, told Guardian Australia that there were 16 trucks and five command staff at the Stokehouse fire, leaving more than 60 vehicles available to respond to the rest of Melbourne.<br></p><p>“When a station goes to a fire we will generally move resources around,” said Youssef.<br></p><p>Referring to the claim that Glen Waverley was unattended for about five hours, he said: “ I’m not sure that that’s correct. What I can tell you is that we have a deputy chief officer monitoring … and he balanced the resources over Melbourne to ensure that all areas were covered.”&nbsp;Youssef added that they had the option to call in CFA resources but it was not deemed necessary and a cool change on Friday afternoon prompted the decision to return to normal operations.</p><p>“We were busy on Friday night and Saturday morning but at no time was anyone within Melbourne or the community put at risk,” he said.<br></p><p>A spokeswoman for Wells said they were not commenting on the claims at this stage “but we are gathering some background from MFB on that”.<br></p>","headline":"Emergency services minister went to tennis while Victorian fires burned","trailText":"Kim Wells concedes it was a bad look to go to the Australian Open, but firefighters union calls it ‘outrageous’<b></b><br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m663","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390539853751/6f27127d-eebe-4dcc-803f-d5841feee86c-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390539853751/6f27127d-eebe-4dcc-803f-d5841feee86c-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427904989","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e1f2e7e4b065f7ddbb8429","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Helen Davidson","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031888","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T16:15:35+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/emergency-services-minister-went-to-tennis-while-victorian-fires-burned","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/emergency-services-minister-went-to-tennis-while-victorian-fires-burned","tags":[{"id":"world/bushfires","webTitle":"Bushfires","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bushfires","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/bushfires","references":[]},{"id":"world/victoria","webTitle":"Victoria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/victoria","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/victoria","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/victorian-politics","webTitle":"Victorian politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/victorian-politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/victorian-politics","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helen-davidson","webTitle":"Helen Davidson","r2ContributorId":"56484","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369271907292/Helen-Davidson(1).jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Davidson is a reporter for Guardian Australia.

threats from activists delay installation at Perth beaches&nbsp;<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-01-24T06:37:48.280Z","body":"<p>The drumlines designed to catch and kill large sharks off the West Australian coastline – which have caused much anger among anti-culling activists – are set to appear in the water this weekend.</p><p>The private contractor charged with laying and monitoring the drumlines in the south-west of the state is believed to have been told to get started in time for the Australia Day long weekend.</p><p>The Fremantle-based fisherman, who has appeared in the media but has not been identified, will lay the lines at beaches at Old Dunsborough, Meelup and Castle Rock, before moving on to Gracetown – the site of the fatal attack late last year that prompted the WA government's controversial policy.</p><p>Old Dunsborough beach is where a 300m-long shark barrier is being trialled, 100m from the shore, just in time for the public holiday.</p><p>The drumlines will appear off the south-west first, after the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/21/shark-cull-greg-hunt-exempts-wa\">granted WA an exemption</a> under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, allowing the protected great white shark to be killed.</p><p>But plans to set drumlines off Perth beaches have been delayed, after potential professional contractors pulled out because of alleged threats from environmental activists.</p><p>Government fisheries officers will now be ordered to perform that duty, beginning within weeks, according to the state government.</p><p>Protesters, however, are determined to disrupt those efforts, with a national rally planned for 1 February.</p><p>Even Hollywood star Ricky Gervais, the creator of the smash-hit comedy The Office, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/23/ricky-gervais-joins-celebrities-in-opposing-wa-shark-cull\">appeared on social media holding up a sign</a> decrying the WA government.</p><p>Gervais later said on Twitter: \"Animals don't have a voice. But I do. A loud one. I'm a fucking big mouth. My voice is for them. And I'll never shut up while they suffer.\"</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/shark-attack-victims-death-was-quick-and-painless\">The death of Chris Boyd</a>&nbsp;</span>at Gracetown was the seventh in WA waters since August 2010 and came only a month after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/09/man-bitten-by-shark-video\">abalone diver Greg Pickering was mauled</a>.</p><p>In seeking the exemption, the state government said the spike in attacks had dented tourism and leisure-based businesses, with recreational diving operators reporting a greater than 90% decrease in people learning to dive.</p><p>But the plan has incensed conservationists, with the Humane Society labelling it \"a complete disgrace\", while thousands of protesters recently rallied against it on a Cottesloe beach frequented by the state's Liberal premier.</p><p>Hunt confirmed that after this summer trial, which ends on 30 April, there would have to be a full federal environment act assessment if the policy was to continue.<br></p>","headline":"Shark catch and kill to begin in Western Australian waters","trailText":"Fisherman to start laying drumlines in state’s south-west, while&nbsp;threats from activists

It was greeted by cheers from regional mediators and diplomats, and was welcomed in Washington.</p><p>President Barack Obama welcomed the ceasefire but said leaders needed to work to resolve the underlying causes of the conflict, and must quickly release political detainees.</p><p>\"South Sudan's leaders must demonstrate their sustained commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis,\" Obama said in a statement.</p><p>\"They have an obligation to ensure that the lives of their people and future of their young country are not further marred by continued violence, and that individuals who have committed atrocities are held to account.\" </p><p>The pact, which marks the first significant breakthrough since a power struggle between Kiir and Machar turned to violence on 15 December, is expected to be implemented within 24 hours of the signing, mediators said. The government also reportedly agreed to release 11 officials close to Machar from detention, a major point of dispute, although no time frame was given.</p><p>Taban Deng, head of the rebel delegation, said he hoped the deal would \"pave the way for a serious national political dialogue aiming at reaching a lasting peace in South Sudan\".</p><p>Government negotiator Nhial Deng Nhial said the talks, which began in Addis Ababa three weeks ago, were \"not easy\". \"We hope to be able to make haste towards an agreement that will end bloodshed,\" he was quoted as saying by AFP.</p><p>But it remains to be seen whether all fighters in South Sudan, a patchwork of rival militias with competing loyalties, will abide by the outcome.</p><p>\"What worries us is whether the agreement on the cessation of hostilities will stick [and] the capacity of the rebel group … to stop fighting,\" Deng said. \"We would like to take this opportunity to urge the rebel group to heed the voice of reason and abandon the quest for political power through violence.\"</p><p>His concern was echoed by a spokesman for the South Sudan's military, who cautioned that a group known as the \"white army\" may not want peace.</p><p>\"Riek Machar has been using that force to fight the SPLA [Sudan People's Liberation Army], so we have to see what will happen,\" Colonel Philip Aguer told the Associated Press. \"Civilians, innocents are dying, so it is good for the people of South Sudan to have peace.\"</p><p>After initial clashes broke out in the presidential guard five weeks ago, the conflict rapidly escalated into war between the regular army, backed by Ugandan troops, and breakaway units and other militia. It also took on an ethnic character as members of Kiir's Dinka tribe clashed with Machar's Nuer group. Some analysts say as many as 10,000 people have died, while close to half a million have been displaced.</p><p>The UN has said it is investigating widespread reports of atrocities and war crimes, including massacres, rapes, summary executions and the use of child soldiers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/south-sudan-soldiers-united-nations-compound-shelter-civilians\" title=\"\">It says 76,000 civilians are under protection at eight of its bases</a>.</p><p>The fighting has also affected South Sudan's oil industry, after technical workers fled and rebel fighters took control for while of the fields.</p><p>Earlier this week government forces recaptured the town of Malakal in the oil-producing Upper Nile state and the last major settlement under rebel control. Large numbers of rebel forces, however, are still massed in rural areas and smaller towns.</p><p>\"To the parties, we say, 'Enough,'\" Alexander Rondos, the EU special representative for the Horn of Africa, said at the signing of the deal on Thursday. \"The killing must end now. The displaced must be able to return to their homes.\"</p><p>The US, which spent billions of dollars helping South Sudan achieve independence in July 2011, also welcomed the deal. The White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \"This is a first critical step in ending the violence … we expect both parties to fully and swiftly implement the agreement.</p><p>\"The United States urges both sides to build on this momentum by moving swiftly to an inclusive political dialogue.\"</p><p>Others sounded a note of caution. Seyoum Mesfin, the chief mediator in Addis Ababa, told the ceremony: \"The crisis that gripped South Sudan is a mere manifestation of the challenges that face the young and fledgling state.</p><p>\"I believe that the postwar challenges will be greater than the war itself. The process will be ... unpredictable and delicate.\"</p><p>There was also scepticism on the streets of Juba, the South Sudanese capital. \"It can solve some of the immediate problems but not all the problems,\" Samuel Kuir Chok, 31, told Reuters. \"I'm not optimistic … because this guy [Machar)] wants to be president at all costs.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.enoughproject.org\" title=\"\">The Enough Project</a>, a US-based advocacy group, said Thursday's deal is only the first step on a long road to a sustainable peace.</p><p>\"If an inclusive peace process is not constructed that seeks to address root causes, the conflict will continue, with deadly consequences,\" said John Prendergast, the group's co-founder, adding it was \"far from guaranteed\" that all combatants would lay down arms just because a deal was signed in Ethiopia.</p><p>José Barahona, Oxfam's country director for South Sudan, added: \"The world's newest nation, plagued by conflict for the past month, has today been given a second chance. With the cessation of hostilities, the focus must now be on rapid reconciliation to aide a fast recovery and set South Sudan on a clear path to development.\" <strong> </strong></p><p>The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, welcomed the agreement, and said both sides must now ensure their forces stop fighting within 24 hours, as stipulated.</p><p>He said: \"The brutal violence of the last month has led to countless deaths and caused thousands of innocent people to endure unimaginable suffering.</p><p>\"The government and opposition must ensure that their forces implement the agreement immediately and in full.</p><p>\"It is now vital that both sides work to heal the divisions that led to this conflict, and to strengthen governance in South Sudan. A genuinely inclusive process of national reconciliation is now needed, to give the people of South Sudan confidence that such violence can never reoccur. The UK is ready to lend its full support to these efforts in South Sudan.</p><p>\"I fully support the African Union's decision to establish a commission of inquiry into alleged crimes committed during the conflict, and call on all sides to co-operate with it to ensure that those responsible for abuses are held accountable.\"\".</p>","headline":"South Sudan ceasefire deal signed","trailText":"<p>Agreement hailed as first step to ending conflict, though  doubts remain and Obama says political detainees must be released</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6v6","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390500349384/South-Sudanese-refugees-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390500349384/South-Sudanese-refugees-006.jpg","wordcount":"1080","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427873292","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8599145","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"David Smith, Africa correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031729","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T18:06:29Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/south-sudan-ceasefire-deal-signed","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/south-sudan-ceasefire-deal-signed","tags":[{"id":"world/south-sudan","webTitle":"South Sudan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/south-sudan","references":[]},{"id":"world/ethiopia","webTitle":"Ethiopia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ethiopia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/ethiopia","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidsmith","webTitle":"David Smith","rcsId":"GNL508721","r2ContributorId":"15571","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/6/1331034359272/David_Smith.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Smith is the Guardian's Africa correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidsmith","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427904108","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390500342052/South-Sudanese-refugees-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","altText":"South Sudanese refugees","height":"54","credit":"EPA","caption":"South Sudanese refugees in Joda, Sudan.

Russia","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-23T22:31:01Z","sectionName":"World news","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2014/jan/23/edward-snowden-nsa-plea-bargain-russia","fields":{"standfirst":"<p>Attorney general prepared to 'engage in conversation' with NSA whistleblower&nbsp;but says full clemency is 'going too far'</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T11:00:37.071Z","body":"<p>The attorney general, Eric Holder, has indicated that the US could allow the national security whistleblower Edward Snowden to return from Russia under negotiated terms, saying he&nbsp;was prepared to “engage in conversation” with him.<br></p><p>Holder said in <a href=\"http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/23/22417513-holder-clemency-for-snowden-too-far-but-open-to-resolution\">an MSNBC interview&nbsp;</a>that full clemency would be “going too far”, but his comments suggest that US authorities are prepared to discuss a possible plea bargain with Snowden, who is living in exile in Russia.</p><p>Snowden, who took part in a <a href=\"http://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden/\">live webchat </a>at about the same time Holder’s remarks were made public, defended his leaks, saying weak whistleblower protection laws prevented him from raising his concerns through formal channels.</p><p>“If we had ... a real process in place, and reports of wrongdoing could be taken to real, independent arbiters rather than captured officials, I might not have had to sacrifice so much to do what at this point even the president seems to agree needed to be done,” Snowden said.&nbsp;</p><p>He gave no indication in the live chat whether he would&nbsp;consider any plea bargain or negotiated return to the US. &nbsp;Asked under what conditions he would return to his native country, Snowden replied: \"Returning to the US, I think, is the best resolution for the government, the public, and myself, but it’s unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws, which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myself.\"</p><p>The Obama&nbsp;administration’s official line is that Snowden is&nbsp;a suspected felon and&nbsp;should be extradited from Russia, where he has been granted temporary asylum, to face trial in the US.&nbsp;Snowden has yet to be publicly indicted by the Justice Department, but in June it charged him with violations of the Espionage Act.</p><p>But Holder is the third senior administration official, including the president, who has made comments that raise the question of Snowden returning to the US under some kind of negotiated terms.</p><p>Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, was repeatedly pressed on Thursday over whether the administration “ruled out” clemency for the whistleblower. “He has been charged with felonies,” Carney replied. “I am not going to wade into those kind of assessments.”</p><p>MSNBC only released short excerpts of its interview with Holder, but reported the attorney general&nbsp;said he “would engage in conversation” with Snowden if he accepted responsibility for leaking government secrets.</p><p>Holder also said full clemency “would be going too far”, according to the network. Asked whether Snowden was a&nbsp;whistleblower, he&nbsp;replied: “I prefer the term defendant. That’s the most apt title.”&nbsp;</p><p>The network said Holder made similar remarks at the University of Virginia, quoting him as saying: “We've always indicated that the notion of clemency isn't something that we were willing to consider. Instead, were he coming back to the US&nbsp;to enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers. ”</p><p>Snowden has never denied leaking the documents, but insisted his decision to provide top-secret documents to reporters working for the Guardian and Washington Post was an act of conscience, designed to inform the public about the nature of NSA surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the webchat, Snowden said he did not believe he would receive a fair trial in the US.&nbsp;\"The 100-year-old law under which I’ve been charged, which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest, and forbids a public interest defence,\" he said. \"This is especially frustrating, because it means there’s no chance to have a fair trial, and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury.\"</p><p>Snowden’s critics have argued that he is not a legitimate whistleblower because he did not take his concerns to intelligence inspectors general or members of Congress on the intelligence oversight committees.</p><p>A former NSA contractor with Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden defended his leaks in the live chat, pointing out that intelligence-community contractors are not covered by whistleblower&nbsp;protection laws.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If I had revealed what I knew about these unconstitutional but classified programs to Congress, they could have charged me with a felony.”</p><p>The whistleblower’s supporters argue out that he would unable to mount a proper defence in a US courtroom, in part because he would be barred from discussing the classified government programs.&nbsp;</p><p>A judge would also be likely to instruct the jury that Snowden’s intentions would&nbsp;not constitute a defence of the charges against him.&nbsp;Some scholars have said Holder should adapt the rules to recognise the unique nature of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Department of Justice and Snowden’s attorneys could agree to conduct it by a slightly different set of rules, rules that would permit the jury to consider the full extent of the alleged governmental wrongdoing he uncovered along with the full scope of his alleged crimes,” Alex Little, a former CIA analyst and assistant US attorney, wrote recently.</p><p>Holder’s remarks are the latest in a series of hints the administration might consider some kind of plea bargain with the former contractor. Such a move that would be deeply unpopular with intelligence officials and their supporters on Capitol Hill.</p><p>In remarks published six days ago, Obama appeared to leave the door open to some kind of arrangement with Snowden.&nbsp;</p><p>A 17,000-word <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/01/27/140127fa_fact_remnick\">New Yorker profile</a> of the the president, written by the magazine’s editor, David Remnick, quoted him as saying Snowden was &nbsp;“not akin to Watergate or some scandal in which there were coverups involved”. &nbsp;He also insisted “the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it”.</p><p>However, in remarks to Remnick the day before he gave last week's long-awaited speech on the NSA, Obama said: “I do not have a yes/no answer on clemency for Edward Snowden. This is an active case, where charges have been brought.”</p><p>Last month, Richard Ledgett, the NSA official in charge of assessing the alleged damage caused by Snowden’s leaks, raised the possibility of an amnesty in return for assurances that top-secret material could be secured.</p><p>“My personal view is, yes, it’s worth having a conversation about,” he told CBS News. “I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high. It would be more than just an assertion on his part.”</p><p>In Thursday’s webchat, Snowden also said a report by the government’s independent civil liberties watchdog, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, vindicated his actions. The divided board found that the bulk collection of Americans’ phone data was illegal and ought to end.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is simply no justification for continuing an unconstitutional policy with a 0% success rate,” Snowden said.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>","headline":"US hints at Edward Snowden plea bargain to allow return from Russia","trailText":"Attorney general prepared to 'engage in conversation' with NSA whistleblower&nbsp;but says full clemency is 'going too far'<br><br>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5tk","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390513517539/0d95c253-41e9-4db6-837d-f426bf6585b1-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390513517539/0d95c253-41e9-4db6-837d-f426bf6585b1-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427846230","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e11b03e4b065f7ddbb83aa","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Paul Lewis, Spencer Ackerman and Dan Roberts in Washington","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031500","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T22:31:01Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/edward-snowden-nsa-plea-bargain-russia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/edward-snowden-nsa-plea-bargain-russia","tags":[{"id":"world/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/edward-snowden","references":[]},{"id":"world/nsa","webTitle":"NSA","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/nsa","references":[]},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/russia","references":[]},{"id":"world/privacy","webTitle":"Privacy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/privacy","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/obama-administration","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-national-security","webTitle":"US national security","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-national-security","references":[]},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/surveillance","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paullewis","webTitle":"Paul Lewis","r2ContributorId":"19990","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/21/1261414668260/paul_lewis.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Lewis is Washington correspondent for the Guardian.

was vandalised on Thursday night, with the words “26th Jan Australia's shame” spraypainted across the building’s facade.<br></p><p>A spokeswoman for City of Melbourne, Bronwyn Perry, confirmed the vandalism of Cook’s Cottage was found on Friday morning and said police are on site investigating.</p><p>“Police are looking at the moment to see what’s been broken … or if anything was stolen,” she said.</p><p>Victoria Police told Guardian Australia it received a call at 7:45am, but the extent of damage was not yet known.</p><p>Pictures of the graffiti show the spraypaint stretching around at least two outside walls and onto a window.</p> <p>The home of Captain James Cook was built in Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, England in 1755. It was bought in 1933 by an Australian businessman for £800 and in 1934 was taken apart, brick by brick, and transported to Australia, along with cuttings of ivy from the garden. The house was rebuilt in Fitzroy Gardens to commemorate the settlement of Melbourne and today is a tourist attraction.</p><p>Cook’s cottage was also vandalised last year, first in January with paint and again in February with the words \"Cappy Cook was a crook killer liar theif\" (sic) graffitied on the building. Responsibility for the act was claimed by Melbourne anarchists.</p><p>“The creation myth of Australian society is that rather than looting, murdering, and displacing the original inhabitants, the Europeans were bringing a higher order of civilisation, economic organisation and religion to savage lands,” read their statement.</p><p>“The denial of this brutal and revolting history is nowhere more evident than on the 25th of January (sic), the celebration of Australia Day – the date of invasion. This is why we trashed the absurd shrine to genocide, Captain Cooks Cottage, with paint.”</p>","headline":"Captain Cook's cottage vandalised with graffiti referencing Australia Day","trailText":"Building attacked on Thursday night, with&nbsp;the words: '26th Jan Australia's shame' daubed across its&nbsp;facade","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m63k","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390515427759/95c22743-e69a-49c0-870a-c23232435ff1-140x84.png","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390515427759/95c22743-e69a-49c0-870a-c23232435ff1-140x84.png","wordcount":"1","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427891256","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e192e7e4b065f7ddbb83f8","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Helen Davidson","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031824","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T22:35:03Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/captain-cooks-cottage-vandalised-with-graffiti-referencing-australia-day","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/captain-cooks-cottage-vandalised-with-graffiti-referencing-australia-day","tags":[{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"world/melbourne","webTitle":"Melbourne","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/melbourne","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/melbourne","references":[]},{"id":"world/victoria","webTitle":"Victoria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/victoria","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/victoria","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helen-davidson","webTitle":"Helen Davidson","r2ContributorId":"56484","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369271907292/Helen-Davidson(1).jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Davidson is a reporter for Guardian Australia.

late on Thursday night, after long talks with President Viktor Yanukovych ended without a major breakthrough.</p><p>The government's failure to grant key concessions was met with anger by thousands of protesters manning the barricades in the capital, while the anti-government protests that have rocked Ukraine spread to other parts of the country during the day.</p><p>On Wednesday, after three people had been killed in clashes with riot police, opposition politician Vitali Klitschko had asked protesters in central Kiev to observe an eight-hour truce while talks went on. Klitschko had promised to \"go on the attack\" if Yanukovych did not launch snap elections within 24 hours, while Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Fatherland party said he was ready to take a \"bullet in the head\".</p><p>The protesters duly extinguished the flaming barricade of tyres that had been set up on the frontline, and the two sides stood facing each other down, the carcasses of burned out police buses between them. But when the trio of opposition leaders emerged after gruelling talks with the president that lasted more than four hours, they had changed their tune, asking for more time and a continuation of the ceasefire.</p><p>\"The only thing we were able to achieve was not much,\" a grim Klitschko told the crowd. He was booed by some of those at the barricade as he asked for a truce.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427888996'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390507987507/Vitali-Klitschko-at-Kiev--011.jpg' alt='Vitali Klitschko at Kiev protests' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Opposition leader and former WBC heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko addresses protesters near the burning barricades in central Kiev.

On Independence Square nationalist leader Oleh Tyahnybok, who was part of the negotiations, put the idea of continuing discussions with the president to a midnight vote among the crowd, and it was overwhelmingly rejected. There are now difficult decisions for the opposition leaders, who have been unable to achieve their key demand of snap elections from Yanukovych but are uneasy about being held responsible for any further violence.</p><p>Earlier in the day Yanukovych suggested holding an emergency parliament session next Tuesday in the hope of ending the standoff, though this alone was unlikely to placate protesters.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-427887056\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/01/23/140123UkraineStrip-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/01/23/140123UkraineStrip/140123UkraineStrip.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/01/23/140123UkraineStrip_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/01/23//140123UkraineStrip.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/01/23/140123UkraineStrip_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>There were dramatic developments in the west of the country too on Thursday as hundreds of people forced their way into the office of the regional governor in the city of Lviv, and forced him to sign a resignation letter.</p><p>The governor, Oleh Salo, a Yanukovych appointee in a city where support for the president is in low single digits, later said he signed the letter under duress and was rescinding his resignation.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427888997'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390478912666/f6d6d8b8-c92a-4b53-93fe-2e054ad02435-460x276.jpeg' alt='A pro-European integration protester carries tyres at the site of clashes with riot police in Kiev.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A pro-European integration protester carries tyres at the site of clashes with riot police in Kiev.

He had been due to participate in a panel at the forum on Friday but was barred in protest at the clashes in Kiev.</p><p>\"All those who support this coup should say clearly, 'yes, we are for the overthrow of the legitimate authorities in Ukraine', and not hide behind peaceful protesters,\" Azarov said. However, he later said that controversial new anti-protest laws, which came into force on Tuesday, could be improved if there was proper dialogue with the opposition.</p><p>The interior ministry claimed the bullets that killed two men in clashes on Wednesday were not of a type used by any police or troops. The authorities have suggested the deaths could have been due to provocateurs.</p><p>A diplomatic initiative to stop the bloodshed gathered pace on Thursday, as Yanukovych fielded calls from a number of European politicians and US vice president Joseph Biden. Additionally, the former  former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called on the US president, Barack Obama, and Russia's Vladimir Putin, to help find a negotiated settlement to Ukraine's conflict.</p><p>In a letter published on his website on Thursday Gorbachev, who has Ukrainian heritage, said: \"Without the help, without the co-operation of authoritative representatives of our two countries this [situation] could lead to catastrophe … I ask you to seize the opportunity and take a decisive step to help Ukraine return to the path of peaceful development.

men in court over public gang-rape in Indian village","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-23T18:01:08Z","sectionName":"World news","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2014/jan/23/court-gang-rape-indian-village-birbhum","fields":{"standfirst":"Attack appears to have been ordered by village council as punishment for 'unauthorised' relationship and failure to pay fine","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T00:06:04Z","body":"<p>Thirteen men detained for the public gang-rape of a 20-year-old woman in a village in eastern India have appeared before a local court, as news of the crime prompted outrage across the country.</p><p>The attack in Birbhum district, about 120 miles from Kolkata, appears to have been a punishment ordered by an unelected traditional village council for an \"unauthorised\" relationship with a married man from another community and the woman's subsequent failure to pay a 27,000 rupee (£260) fine.</p><p>A complaint filed by the victim's family described how the council chief told villagers that because the woman could not pay the fine they were free to \"enjoy the girl and have fun\".</p><p>The woman described the protracted attack, which took place on Monday night in front of dozens of onlookers, to local reporters. She said she lost count of the number of assailants, who she said included several of her neighbours.</p><p>Officials said medical investigations had backed the woman's claim of repeated rape by between five and 15 men.</p><p>\"Prima facie the woman was gang-raped by a group of villagers following a kangaroo court where she and her fiance were fined for their so-called extramarital relationship. A complaint was lodged with Labhpur police station against 13 persons. All the accused have been arrested,\" said the local police superintendent, Birbhum Sudhakar.</p><p>Witnesses in the village described how the woman was first raped on a bamboo platform in the centre of the small cluster of mud-walled huts surrounded by fields before being locked in a hut during the night where she was assaulted again.</p><p>\"She lost a lot of blood and remains in a critical condition. She only survived because she is very tough,\" said a senior medical official at the hospital where the victim is being treated.</p><p>The wife of the married mason with whom the victim had a relationship sold jewellery to pay his fine. The victim's family had no savings.</p><p>India has been hit by a wave of sexual violence – particularly gang-rapes – in recent years. Last week a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/danish-tourist-gang-raped-delhi-india\" title=\"\">51-year-old tourist in Delhi</a> was raped by at least five men who attacked while she was walking back to her hotel. There have been several other similar attacks on foreigners.</p><p>The gang-rape and murder of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/12/delhi-gang-rape-death-transformed-lives\" title=\"\">23-year-old Indian woman in Delhi in December 2012</a> prompted grief and outrage across the country, with thousands taking to the streets in protests demanding tougher laws, better policing and a shift in cultural&nbsp;attitudes.</p><p>The United Nations asked India, the world's second most populous country, to ensure security for women. But although prison terms for rape have been stiffened, stalking made a criminal offence and gender sensitivity programmes introduced for some police officers, little appears to have changed on the ground.</p><p>Birbhum is in West Bengal state, which appears to be a particular blackspot. Last month a worker at a gym was abducted and raped by five men in a truck.</p><p>In October a woman was raped twice by the same group of men, once as she returned from a police station where she had recorded a statement about the first attack, and was then set on fire. She died of her injuries.</p><p>West Bengal is governed by the Trinamool Congress party (TMC), which has been under fire for failing to halt the rising sexual violence. Its chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, is a firebrand political outsider and one of the most powerful women in India.</p><p>Derek O'Brien, a TMC parliamentarian, promised \"swift action … zero tolerance\", in a message on Twitter on Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/political-parties-condemn-gang-rape-of-tribal-girl-in-west-bengal-474631\" title=\"\">Opposition politicians</a> in West Bengal called the incident barbaric.</p><p>The attack has focused attention on the informal village councils and courts run by local male elders, which are common across much of rural India.</p><p>Although technically illegal, they are frequently responsible for inflicting cruel, sometimes lethal, punishments for supposed social transgressions such as marrying without prior consent. Such courts also frequently oblige relatives to take violent action to restore the \"honour\" of a community.</p><p>In one incident four years ago in Birbhum , village elders ordered tribal women to strip and walk naked in front of large crowds as a punishment for \"unauthorised\" relationships.</p><p>Manish Tewari, India's information minister, said in Delhi: \"In a democratic country, based upon the rule of law, no vigilantism can be permitted.\"</p><p>In the latest case, those arrested and the victim are from an <em>adivasi</em> or tribal community, who are among the poorest and most marginalised in India. West Bengal has social indicators that are worse than many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The council appears to have acted after finding the woman sitting with her lover under a tree. Following the attack, villagers threatened the badly injured victim and her family. Nearly 48 hours later, relatives managed to take her to a clinic from where she was transferred to a hospital. Only then were law enforcement agencies alerted.</p><p>The causes of the wave of sexual violence, and its extent, are hotly debated. Many commentators say it is a consequence of the efforts of a growing number of women, even in remote rural areas, to claim basic freedoms denied for centuries. Others point to India's acute gender imbalance, tenacious caste system, apathetic police, inefficient judiciary and entrenched patriarchal culture.

coming to these sort of meetings, because they don't care about the community, they care about themselves and how they can screw the system.\"</p><p>The MP's remarks were made shortly before the
