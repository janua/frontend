Of these, many are publicity hand-outs, soft paparazzi images and material for the sports pages.<br><br>However, among all these photographs there are some real gems. The agencies that the Guardian subscribes to – AP, Reuters and Getty Images, among others – have some truly great photojournalists on their staff and under contract, although they probably would be too modest to describe themselves as such. We would like to recognise some of these unsung heroes by presenting their work in galleries, rather than publish them in the usual, one-off, spot news format.","type":"series","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/series/from-the-agencies","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/series/from-the-agencies","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/photography","webTitle":"Photography","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/photography","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.
