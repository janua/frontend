The passengers were taken off in five groups, with two further flights to pick up their baggage. Each flight took around 20 minutes each way.</p><p>Four expedition staff were the last to leave the trapped ship.

We know how far out of your way you all went.\"</p><p>AMSA released a statement at 12.45 pm on Thursday saying the safest option was to do the rescue mission in one operation. \"AMSA understands that current sea ice conditions prevent the barge from Aurora Australis from reaching the Chinese vessel Xue Long (Snow Dragon) and a rescue may not be possible today,\" a spokeswoman said.</p><p>\"The Xue Long's helicopter is unable to land on the Aurora Australis due to load rating restrictions. It is not safe to land the helicopter next to Aurora Australis at this time.</p><p>\"The preferred and safest option at this stage is to ultimately transfer the passengers onto Aurora Australis.\"</p><p>Jha earlier said the mood was subdued but optimistic and people had kept themselves busy. \"If there is any anger/upset etc I haven't seen any,\" he said in an email.</p><p>\"I imagine some people have had private moments of anxiety or frustration but there's no feeling of threat or any worry about danger. No one seems scared.\"</p><p>The Akademik Shokalskiy became stuck in thick pack ice on Christmas Eve and the Aurora Australis and Xue Long, which are both icebreakers, had to abandon attempts to reach the trapped ship.</p><p>An attempt on New Year's Day to evacuate the passengers by helicopter was also abandoned because of heavy rain, strong winds and cloud.</p>","headline":"Antarctic helicopter rescue mission a success","trailText":"Passengers trapped on Akademik Shokalskiy since Christmas Eve safely evacuated to Aurora Australis icebreaker ship<br />","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yh68","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/2/1388662955833/This-picture-taken-by-the-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/2/1388662955833/This-picture-taken-by-the-006.jpg","wordcount":"523","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426126977","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8506677","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Bridie Jabour","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2020229","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-05T11:46:10Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/02/antarctic-helicopter-mission-rescue-success","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/02/antarctic-helicopter-mission-rescue-success","tags":[{"id":"world/antarctica","webTitle":"Antarctica","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/antarctica","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"environment/poles","webTitle":"Polar regions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/poles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/poles","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/bridie-jabour","webTitle":"Bridie Jabour","r2ContributorId":"56485","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/27/1369625233941/Bridie-Jabour.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Bridie Jabour is a reporter for Guardian Australia.
