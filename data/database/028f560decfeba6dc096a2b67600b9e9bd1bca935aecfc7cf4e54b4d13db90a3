The first killed one person and injured four after a passing driver threw a grenade at police vehicles, officials said. No casualties were reported from the second blast.</p><p>The explosions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/egypt-police-massacre-jihadi-activity]\" title=\"\">mark an apparent escalation of an insurgency waged by Islamist extremists</a> since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi last July, which has killed more than 100 police officers and soldiers. It follows an audio warning released overnight by Egypt's most prominent extremist group, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which previously claimed responsibility for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/egyptian-interior-minister-survives-car-bomb\" title=\"\">a failed attack on Egypt's interior minister</a>, and last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/24/egyptian-police-headquarters-explosion\" title=\"\">bomb at a northern police headquarters</a>  which killed 16 officers.</p><p>The group has repeatedly condemned the police, who were the target of all three of Friday's explosions, for the post-Morsi crackdown on Islamists.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427931416'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390550836469/82288d7e-e0f0-477c-9799-5fbac703077c-460x276.jpeg' alt='A man carries an Egyptian police officer to an ambulance after the car bombing in central Cairo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A man carries an Egyptian police officer to an ambulance after the car bombing in central Cairo.

It severely damaged the collection of the Islamic Museum, which stands opposite the targeted building, after debris crushed much of the museum's glass and ceramic artefacts.</p><p>The attacks may strengthen the hand of Egypt's current government, which has justified <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story#part-one\" title=\"\">its ongoing crackdown on dissent</a> as an essential means of combatting terrorism. More than 1,000 Morsi supporters have been killed in the crackdown, and thousands more arrested since July.</p><p>Officials and almost all media outlets say Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist group that is behind all attacks on the Egyptian state – but have thus far provided no evidence of their involvement.</p><p>Onlookers at the site of the first blast loudly backed the government's narrative, immediately blaming the Muslim Brotherhood for the attack.</p><p>\"The people demand the execution of the Brotherhood,\" chanted a crowd of bystanders, some of whom carried pictures of General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief who ousted Morsi.</p><p>Two mobs attacked a van suspected by some of containing members of the Brotherhood. Further down the road, police officers advised drivers with beards – a sign of religious piety – to turn around to avoid being attacked.</p><p>A Muslim Brotherhood-led coalition has planned nationwide protests after Friday prayers as part of their near-daily demonstrations against the overthrow of Morsi and the recent vote on the country's rewritten constitution.</p><p>Morsi supporters, Sisi supporters, and pro-democracy activists opposed to both men's authoritarianism all plan to mark Saturday's third anniversary of the 2011 uprising with rival demonstrations.</p>","headline":"Cairo rocked by explosions on eve of 2011 uprising anniversary","trailText":"At least five dead in three attacks that mark apparent escalation of insurgency waged by Islamist extremists","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m68y","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/24/1390559344282/Site-of-explosion-at-Egyp-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/24/1390559344282/Site-of-explosion-at-Egyp-004.jpg","wordcount":"713","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427918848","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8600857","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031960","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T10:33:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/cairo-explosions-anniversary-egypt","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/cairo-explosions-anniversary-egypt","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/27/1377598831910/patrick140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

than prices between April 2012 and April 2013.</p><p>Before a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/davos-2014-world-economic-forum-day-three-live\" title=\"\">key speech on the economy</a>, the prime minister called on people to be patient about living standards, arguing that they were slowly beginning to get better.</p><p>Cameron told the BBC: \"We are seeing some positive signs in terms of take-home pay. But it's going to take time. We need to be patient and work through our economic plan so it's a recovery that lasts and benefits everyone.\"</p><p>Cameron urged people to bear in mind that Britain was \"recovering from the longest and deepest recession in living memory\".</p><p>\"I think it will be sustainable if we deal with the problems that we had before the recovery came,\" he added.</p><p>However, a word of caution about the government claims came from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who said they were contradicted by official data on earnings from the Office for National Statistics watchdog.</p><p>He also said it was \"pretty clear\" that incomes would not return to their pre-recession levels before the next election.</p><p>Speaking on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qj9z\" title=\"\">BBC Radio 4's Today programme</a>, he said: \"The government has used a perfectly sensible set of numbers, which are its definition of take-home pay. Using the survey it's looking at, that clearly shows that from April 2012 to April 2013, gross pay for most people went up faster than CPI inflation, and it's important that there are different measures of inflation they could have used, and that happened for most people, when you take into account the increase in the personal allowance, then yes, over that period, according to that dataset, those people are getting better off.</p><p>\"But there are two problems with this that one needs to take into account. First, actually, we have other sets of data. The ONS publishes an average weekly earnings index. That went up really quite a lot less quickly than inflation in the most recent months, and of course, they're not taking into account things like benefits which are occurring over time. So if you're looking at household incomes that will be different from what's happened to take-home pay.\"</p><p>Johnson said people might now not be getting worse off, but he suggested living standards were still a long way from recovery.</p><p>\"We will be able to say definitively, pretty sure, that come 2015, average household incomes will be lower than they were pre-recession, and lower than they were in 2010.\"</p><p>Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/426648679068758016\" title=\"\">entered the argument</a>, tweeting that \"all the PM does by telling Britain there isn't a cost of living crisis is show millions of people he doesn't understand their lives\".</p><p>Cathy Jamieson, a Labour shadow Treasury minister, accused the government of trying to avoid the reality of a cost-of-living crisis, as the figures \"do not show the impact of things like cuts to tax credits and child benefit\".</p><p>\"It's not a question of ignoring the statistics,\" she told the same programme. \"If we want to look at the figures, the truth is that under this government real wages have fallen by £1,600 a year and the IFS's figures show families are an average of £890 worse off as a result of tax and benefit changes. I think … that is hitting people hard.\"</p><p>However, Matthew Hancock, a business minister, defended his department's use of the take-home pay figures and argued that living standards were beginning to improve.</p><p>\"To say people are worse off now than the great recession is of course true because national income fell by over 7% and you would expect that automatically to have an impact on people's purse, on people's wallets,\" he said. \"But what these figures show is that is just starting to abate.\"</p><p>No 10 is hopeful that a gradual increase in living standards and return to growth will undermine Labour's argument about the cost-of-living crisis before the next election.</p><p>In a speech to business people in Davos, Switzerland, the prime minister presented his most optimistic long-term vision of the UK economy for many years on Friday, saying Britain could become \"the reshore nation\" with businesses bringing production back to the UK.</p><p>He said: \"There is no doubt that when it comes to reshoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas, which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade.</p><p>\"I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the reshore nation.\"</p><p>In response, Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, highlighted a growing trade deficit.</p><p>\"Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back.</p><p>\"But after so many government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice.\"</p>","headline":"Cameron's 'good news' about rising incomes is misleading says Labour","trailText":"PM says take-home pay

The process will not be finalised before the end of 2014, a spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) admitted.</p><p>It was an \"unfortunate anomaly\", said a spokesman from the gay rights group Stonewall, who said the organisation had been lobbying hard on the issue.</p><p>Paul, 34, who has twin seven-year-old sons with partner Michael, 29, said: \"We're being penalised because we're already in a civil partnership. No couple should be asked to divorce or dissolve to be able to get married. To dissolve a civil partnership, you have to go to court, and you have to have a valid reason. Wanting to get married is hardly a valid reason to dissolve a civil partnership, so we would effectively have had to commit perjury.\"</p><p>Dissolution of a civil partnership is only possible on grounds of unreasonable behaviour, two years' desertion, two year's separation (with the respondent's consent), or five years' separation (without consent).</p><p>\"For us this is about equality,\" said Paul. \"But it's not just the principle of the situation – there are legal and practical difficulties if we were forced to divorce. If our civil partnership were dissolved there would be a period of time when we would not be each other's next of kin, for example.\"</p><p>The men want to raise awareness of the problem, believing that many other couples may unknowingly be in the same situation.</p><p>Now the couple have instructed lawyers after being told that because of delays in implementing parts of the act, they would have to get a formal dissolution before they can marry.</p><p>Their solicitors Irwin Mitchell have now written to the culture secretary, Maria Miller, warning of potential judicial review action if the issue is not resolved satisfactorily.</p><p>Irwin Mitchell believes there are breaches of British equality and human rights law, and that the government has failed to take into account all relevant considerations when creating the equal marriage laws.</p><p>Zoe Round, a specialist family lawyer at Irwin Mitchell solicitors in Sheffield, said: \"Our clients are naturally devastated at the prospect of having to go through a formal dissolution before they can get married. They had been waiting for this legislation to be agreed for years and now, at the final hurdle, are finding that the process just doesn't seem to have been thought through.</p><p>\"All necessary considerations should have been taken into account by the government before the announcement was made that the first same-sex marriages could happen from 29 March 2014.</p><p>\"We have written to the government to ask them to implement the process of conversion from a civil partnership to a same-sex marriage as was intended by parliament in section 9 of the act, so that couples that want to marry don't have to go through a dissolution of their civil partnership before their ceremony.</p><p>\"Why should they be forced to get a dissolution just to remarry? It seems absurd and we are supporting them in their fight to remedy the situation. If the issue cannot be resolved then we may have no choice but to seek a judicial review in the high court.\"</p><p>A DCMS spokeswoman said: \"We are continuing to work hard to ensure that couples wanting to convert their civil partnerships into marriages are able to do so as soon as possible. We aim to do this before the end of 2014.</p><p>\"It will take a little longer because we need to introduce completely new procedures and processes. This contrasts with the work to make new marriages for same-sex couples possible, where we have been able to build on existing processes so implementation is more straightforward.</p><p>\"The conversion process will ensure that couples in civil partnerships do not have a break in their legal relationship, which could have implications for matters such as their pension entitlements.\"</p>","headline":"Gay couple threaten to sue UK government over same-sex marriage","trailText":"Michael and Paul Atwal-Brice found they could not marry unless they first formally dissolved their civil partnership","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m69e","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390561019555/A-cake-for-a-gay-wedding-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390561019555/A-cake-for-a-gay-wedding-006.jpg","wordcount":"765","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427921814","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8598873","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Helen Pidd, northern editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031980","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T10:57:41Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/24/gay-couple-sue-uk-same-sex-marriage-civil-partnership","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/2014/jan/24/gay-couple-sue-uk-same-sex-marriage-civil-partnership","tags":[{"id":"society/gay-marriage","webTitle":"Gay marriage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/gay-marriage","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/gay-marriage","references":[]},{"id":"world/gay-rights","webTitle":"Gay rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gay-rights","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/gay-rights","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/marriage","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/marriage","references":[]},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/sexuality","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/sexuality","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenpidd","webTitle":"Helen Pidd","r2ContributorId":"19855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/6/22/1277217764498/Helen-Pidd-byline.-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Pidd is northern editor of the Guardian, based in Manchester.

After the Great Moderation and the Great Recession, there are several reasons why it will be years before any superlatives are attached to this recovery.\"</p><p>Carney said overall debt burdens of advanced countries had increased since the crisis, the global economy remained unbalanced and confidence remained fragile.</p><p>But he said policymakers had avoided the mistakes made during the 1930s and there was a chance that a new wave of innovations would lead to a new era of growth, following the pattern of the post second world war boom.</p><p>\"Protectionism is being resisted, banks recapitalised, and the global financial system rebuilt. In parallel, monetary policy is highly accommodative,\" he said.</p><p>\"As the global economy gains momentum, staying the course on these policies will be decisive to achieving escape velocity. The United Kingdom is at the centre of these decisions.\"</p><p>Carney admitted that unemployment had fallen faster than predicted since August when the Bank set a 7% jobless rate as the threshold for considering higher interest rates.</p><p>\"The latest data show that more than a quarter of a million jobs were created in a three-month period – the biggest increase since records began in 1971. As a result, unemployment seems to be falling at a pace that will reach our 7% threshold materially earlier than we had expected.\"</p><p>Many City economists expect unemployment to hit 7% within the next couple of months, but Carney said this would not lead to rates being raised from 0.5%, where they have been since early 2009.</p><p>\"Crucially, unemployment remains above the level that is likely to be consistent with maintaining inflation at the target in the medium term. It is not just that nearly three quarters of a million more people are out of work than before the crisis; another three quarters of a million more people are involuntarily working part time.\"</p><p>Giving a clear signal that he favoured amending forward guidance to take account of the improving labour market, the governor said: \"It now seems likely that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation in the medium term is somewhat lower than the MPC assessed back in August.</p><p>\"In part that is because rates of transition into jobs, even for those who have been unemployed for more than a year, have been sustained at high rates, minimising the extent of skill atrophy. In addition, other measures of slack in the labour market, such as involuntary part-time working remain high.</p><p>\"This suggests that, even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of monetary policy. It is widely recognised that our 7% threshold is not a trigger for raising Bank Rate.\"</p><p>Carney said that when the Bank announced forward guidance it made clear that the 7% unemployment threshold was not an interest-rate trigger.</p><p>\"The MPC will consider a range of options to update our guidance, recognising both what we have learned about the behaviour of aggregate supply in the economy as well as the more benign inflation outlook.\"</p>","headline":"UK economy well short of escape velocity, Mark Carney tells Davos","trailText":"Bank of England governor pledges that 'path of interest rates will be consistent with sustained recovery'","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6bt","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564135189/Mark-Carney-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564135189/Mark-Carney-006.jpg","wordcount":"757","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427929462","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601208","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Larry Elliott and Jill Treanor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032038","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T12:26:18Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/uk-economy-escape-velocity-mark-carney-interest-rates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/24/uk-economy-escape-velocity-mark-carney-interest-rates","tags":[{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/interest-rates","webTitle":"Interest rates","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/interest-rates","references":[]},{"id":"business/bankofenglandgovernor","webTitle":"Bank of England","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos-2014","webTitle":"Davos 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos-2014","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos","webTitle":"Davos","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos","references":[]},{"id":"profile/larryelliott","webTitle":"Larry Elliott","rcsId":"GNL001696","r2ContributorId":"15965","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/larry_elliott_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Larry Elliott is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics\">economics</a> editor and has been with the paper since 1988</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/larryelliott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/larryelliott","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jilltreanor","webTitle":"Jill Treanor","rcsId":"GNL003510","r2ContributorId":"15822","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jill_treanor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jill Treanor is the Guardian's City editor.

It would be the first direct contact between the opposing parties since the anti-Assad uprising began in March 2011. An estimated 130,000 people have been killed since then, two million Syrians have fled abroad and nine million in all are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>Angry remarks in Montreux by Muallem left the western-backed Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) claiming that it alone was committed to the 2012 agreement – known as Geneva I – to create a \"transitional governing body\". Assad, president since succeeding his father in 2000, has insisted repeatedly that he will not step down. The opposition says he must go. Brahimi's problem is how to square that circle</p><p>Ahmed al-Jarba, the SOC president, said on Thursday: \"The Syrian revolution has achieved recognition internationally. The world has seen a people who were refused their rights for 40 years by a criminal and his family. When the people opposed him they were hit by chemical weapons. Bullets are their only answer to the voice of freedom. This regime is dead.\"</p><p>Muallem warned, however, that the SOC did not represent the opposition. He said efforts to achieve a political result were premature. The priority was \"to fight terrorism and this paves the way for the start of the political process\", he said, according to Syria's state news agency.</p><p>The propaganda and spin intensified in advance of the talks, with the opposition performing better than before – and far better than the Syrian government – with the assistance of strategic communications advisers provided by the British government and other western backers.</p><p>Many predict that the Brahimi talks are doomed to fail as the Syrian protagonists will prove unable to agree on a transition – as stipulated in the Geneva I communique, \"by mutual consent\" – or to overcome their intense mutual loathing. Shaaban scorned the opposition delegation in Montreux as American puppets. Muallem called them \"terrorists and traitors\".</p><p>The SOC has suffered from grave internal divisions and poor credibility. It faces stiff resistance from Islamist fighting groups and activists in Syria who insist there is no point in negotiating with Assad. To counter this, it is advertising an effort to include representatives of the Free Syrian Army and the newly created Syrian Revolutionary Front on its team.</p><p>It is also emphasising that only these forces are capable of fighting the al-Qaida-linked groups, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Jabhat al-Nusra. The SOC accuses the government of colluding with extremists to bolster the narrative that Syria faces a choice between Assad or al-Qaida.</p><p>\"Assad attempts to present himself as a credible partner on counter-terrorism,\" said Oubai Shahbandar, an opposition adviser. \"We want to use Geneva to turn the tables and show the world that we are the solution to fighting al-Qaida.\"</p><p>Al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, appealed on Thursday for an end to fighting \"between the holy warriors of Islam\" and urged them to concentrate on \"bringing down Assad's secular, sectarian, unjust and criminal regime to set up a just Islamic state\".</p><p>An estimated 1,400 people have died in internecine clashes this year.</p><p>Haitham al-Maleh, a veteran democracy activist, said he believed international pressure would eventually force a solution. \"We will succeed and the regime will be finished,\" Maleh said. \"It's clear that even Russia believes that Bashar al-Assad can't be part of the future.\"</p><p>Naim Kosayyer, of the Syrian Association for the Rights of Detainees and the Disappeared, said of the negotiations: \"So far the regime has only been talking to other countries. Now they will be speaking to Syrians – and Syrians will know how to respond in their own way.\"</p><p>Samir al-Taqi, an independent political scientist and opposition sympathiser, said: \"The Geneva process won't work by itself and the regime will not be knocked out in one blow. It will be defeated through the gradual erosion of the state. But the talks are another battlefield.\"</p><p>Western diplomats admit they do not have a clear idea of how the negotiations will pan out and how Brahimi will take things forward. The UN mediator has said he has \"indications\" of readiness for confidence-building measures, such as a ceasefire or prisoner exchanges. \"This conflict will only end by a political solution,\" one senior official said. \"But it's possible that Geneva II can't deliver it.\"</p>","headline":"Syria's foreign minister threatens to walk out of peace talks","trailText":"Walid Muallem says he will leave Geneva unless 'serious' talks begin by Saturday, as UN mediator meets both sides separately","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6ah","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562791120/Syrias-foreign-minister-W-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562791120/Syrias-foreign-minister-W-006.jpg","wordcount":"825","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427925638","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601134","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ian Black in Geneva and agencies","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032010","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:27:01Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/syrian-face-to-face-peace-talks-break-down","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/syrian-face-to-face-peace-talks-break-down","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ianblack","webTitle":"Ian Black","rcsId":"GNL014381","r2ContributorId":"15738","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/ian_black_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ian Black is the Guardian's Middle East editor.

Asked whether Snowden was a&nbsp;whistleblower, he&nbsp;replied: “I prefer the term defendant. That’s the most apt title.”&nbsp;</p><p>The network said Holder made similar remarks at the University of Virginia, quoting him as saying: “We've always indicated that the notion of clemency isn't something that we were willing to consider. Instead, were he coming back to the US&nbsp;to enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers. ”</p><p>Snowden has never denied leaking the documents, but insisted his decision to provide top-secret documents to reporters working for the Guardian and Washington Post was an act of conscience, designed to inform the public about the nature of NSA surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the webchat, Snowden said he did not believe he would receive a fair trial in the US.&nbsp;\"The 100-year-old law under which I’ve been charged, which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest, and forbids a public interest defence,\" he said. \"This is especially frustrating, because it means there’s no chance to have a fair trial, and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury.\"</p><p>Snowden’s critics have argued that he is not a legitimate whistleblower because he did not take his concerns to intelligence inspectors general or members of Congress on the intelligence oversight committees.</p><p>A former NSA contractor with Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden defended his leaks in the live chat, pointing out that intelligence-community contractors are not covered by whistleblower&nbsp;protection laws.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If I had revealed what I knew about these unconstitutional but classified programs to Congress, they could have charged me with a felony.”</p><p>The whistleblower’s supporters argue out that he would unable to mount a proper defence in a US courtroom, in part because he would be barred from discussing the classified government programs.&nbsp;</p><p>A judge would also be likely to instruct the jury that Snowden’s intentions would&nbsp;not constitute a defence of the charges against him.&nbsp;Some scholars have said Holder should adapt the rules to recognise the unique nature of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Department of Justice and Snowden’s attorneys could agree to conduct it by a slightly different set of rules, rules that would permit the jury to consider the full extent of the alleged governmental wrongdoing he uncovered along with the full scope of his alleged crimes,” Alex Little, a former CIA analyst and assistant US attorney, wrote recently.</p><p>Holder’s remarks are the latest in a series of hints the administration might consider some kind of plea bargain with the former contractor. Such a move that would be deeply unpopular with intelligence officials and their supporters on Capitol Hill.</p><p>In remarks published six days ago, Obama appeared to leave the door open to some kind of arrangement with Snowden.&nbsp;</p><p>A 17,000-word <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/01/27/140127fa_fact_remnick\">New Yorker profile</a> of the the president, written by the magazine’s editor, David Remnick, quoted him as saying Snowden was &nbsp;“not akin to Watergate or some scandal in which there were coverups involved”. &nbsp;He also insisted “the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it”.</p><p>However, in remarks to Remnick the day before he gave last week's long-awaited speech on the NSA, Obama said: “I do not have a yes/no answer on clemency for Edward Snowden. This is an active case, where charges have been brought.”</p><p>Last month, Richard Ledgett, the NSA official in charge of assessing the alleged damage caused by Snowden’s leaks, raised the possibility of an amnesty in return for assurances that top-secret material could be secured.</p><p>“My personal view is, yes, it’s worth having a conversation about,” he told CBS News. “I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high. It would be more than just an assertion on his part.”</p><p>In Thursday’s webchat, Snowden also said a report by the government’s independent civil liberties watchdog, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, vindicated his actions.

his own health and safety, a judge said on Friday.</p><p>The 76-year-old was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/28/ian-brady-tribunal-ruling\" title=\"\">told last year his appeal to be sent to a prison to serve his sentence was to be refused</a>, but on Friday Judge Robert Atherton gave the reasons for the decision in a detailed ruling running to more than 100 pages.</p><p>Brady, 76, was told last June that he is to remain a patient at maximum-security Ashworth hospital, Merseyside, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/28/ian-brady-learned-moors-murderer\" title=\"\">after a week-long mental health tribunal hearing</a>.</p><p>The child-killer's £250,000 taxpayer-funded legal bid to be transferred was the first time he had been seen in public for decades and was criticised by victims' families who said it was a circus and a complete waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p>Brady, who murdered five children in the 1960s with his lover Myra Hindley, was jailed for life in 1966.</p><p>The decision to reject his appeal was given by Atherton, who chaired the three-man tribunal panel at Ashworth.</p><p>At the end of the hearing, the panel said Brady should remain in Ashworth on the grounds that he is insane and hospital staff are best placed to treat his psychosis.</p><p>Atherton said: \"The tribunal concluded that it has been demonstrated by this evidence that it is necessary in the interests of his own health and safety that he be detained in hospital for treatment and that appropriate treatment is available.</p><p>\"The tribunal considered that it would be inappropriate to make any recommendation because, in its judgment, it is not appropriate to recommend his discharge.\"</p><p>The 116-page ruling says Brady's wishes must be taken into consideration.</p><p>\"His views are important because he will spend the rest of his life either in a hospital or in prison. There is no possibility of him being discharged into the community.</p><p>\"However, the determination of that issue depends substantially upon his mental condition, about which there is an array of opinions among the medical practitioners who gave evidence to the tribunal.\"</p><p>The tribunal said that with the benefit of hindsight Brady should have been transferred to hospital for treatment before he had served 19 years in various prisons.</p><p>The ruling adds: \"One must also remember that he is now a 75-year-old man. When he was in prison he was much younger. He is now physically much weaker. But his notoriety has not diminished.</p><p>\"The inmates of a prison would not be selected as the other patients on the ward are. That would create a significant risk to his safety, even though the prison officers are acknowledged to have the skills to deal with such issues.\"</p><p>The tribunal accepted that Brady is suffering from chronic psychotic illness but there were differences in eminent medical opinion demonstrating the complexity of his condition.</p><p>The ruling quoted from his medical history, citing case notes prior to his sentence in 1966 by Dr Lindsay Neustatter, senior physician in psychological medicine, describing Brady as \"a ruthless individual, cold and unemotional, without conscience or remorse … He showed a pathological admiration of power and unscrupulousness\".</p><p>Another medical officer later wrote: \"[Brady is a] schizoid psychopath of utter untruthfulness who has the rather unusual ability in this type of personality of dissociating himself from the crimes of which he has been convicted … Increasingly I feel that it is a symptom of the terrifying intensity of his psychopathy, and that he is not defending against recalling his offences but that, as far as he is concerned, they fail to rise above his mental horizon.\"</p><p>Brady has the right to challenge the decision, which would require a further hearing at an upper tribunal.</p><p>There was no immediate response from his legal team to the findings.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/25/ian-brady-tells-tribunal-not-psychotic\" title=\"\">Brady told the hearing </a> that he was merely a a petty criminal and described his crimes as recreational killings which were part of an existential experience.</p><p>Brady's legal team argued that, despite his severe personality disorder, he is not mentally ill and therefore no longer fulfils the legal criteria for detention in hospital.</p><p>Brady has suggested that if he is allowed to go back to a jail he would be free to end his own life by starving himself to death.</p><p>Last year's tribunal heard that Brady, who claims to have been on a hunger strike since 1999 and is fed through a tube in his nose, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/24/ian-brady-hunger-strike-charade-tribunal\" title=\"\">in fact eats toast and soup</a> and that this is simply a protest rather than suicidal.</p><p>It was suggested that Brady's legal bid showed his pathological need for control and to challenge authority and a craving for the public spotlight.</p><p>Hospital records showed that Brady has hallucinations, talks to himself while alone, has been violent and abusive to other patients and staff, and leads a largely nocturnal existence, leaving his room at night only, and shunning other patients and staff he regards as beneath him.</p><p>Brady and Hindley lured children and teenagers to their deaths, before burying four youngsters on Saddleworth moor above Manchester.</p><p><a

At the start of 2014, the financial gurus looked into their crystal balls and said that for the first time since the crash of 2008 they were more worried about emerging markets than the dull old west.</p><p></p><p>There was some difference of opinion about where the sell-off would start. Some said Turkey, some said Indonesia, some thought history would repeat itself with Thailand being the first domino to fall, as it was in 1997.</p><p></p><p>Few picked on Argentina, perhaps because the second biggest economy in South America has appeared to be highly vulnerable for some time. Yet attention is now focused on Buenos Aires after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/argentinian-peso-freefall-economic-crisis-deepens\" title=\"\">the steepest fall in the peso since the crisis of 2002</a>.</p><p></p><p>That was the cue for a rapid search for safe havens, such as the dollar, as investors decided to dump all the other emerging market currencies. A mood that was already jittery as a result of concern about the impact of the gradual withdrawal of tapering by the Federal Reserve turned nasty very quickly.</p><p></p><p>The trigger for the run on the peso was the decision by Argentina's central bank to stop intervening in the markets to defend the currency. The policy was proving extremely costly, draining Argentina of its foreign currency reserves.</p><p></p><p>With high inflation already a problem, Christina Fernandez's government has been trying to prevent a fall in the value of the peso from pushing up the cost of living by raising the cost of import. The government even imposed restrictions on online shopping this week in response to capital flight and a ballooning balance of payments problem.</p><p></p><p>That policy is now in tatters. Just like the Bank of England in September 1992, Argentina has decided enough is enough and stopped intervening before the central bank is cleaned out completely.</p><p></p><p>So what happens now? In Argentina, there is the prospect of capital flight, a sharp fall in the peso and higher inflation. In emerging markets more generally there is the prospect of contagion. Brazil, as Argentina's neighbour and a country already identified as one of the fragile five emerging markets (India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa are the others) looks most vulnerable.</p><p></p><p>For the global economy, Argentina can be read one of two ways.

He added that Asaro had given him \"marching orders\" that \"there will be no plea and he will walk out the door a free man\".</p><p>A lawyer for Jerome Asaro declined comment.</p><p>The indictment accused Asaro of helping to direct the Lufthansa Airlines heist at Kennedy airport on 11 December 1978, one of the largest cash thefts in American history.</p><p>The gunmen looted a vault in the airline's cargo terminal and stole about $5m in untraceable US currency that was being returned to the United States from Germany, along with about $1m worth of jewellery. The cash was never found.</p><p>According to court papers, an unidentified mob associate who pleaded guilty and became a co-operating witness told investigators that he participated in the robbery at the direction of Asaro. The theft was hatched by James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Burke, a late Lucchese crime family associate who was close to Asaro, who told the bandits that he had a \"score\" that would make them rich.</p><p>The papers say that each robber was supposed to be paid $750,000, but the co-operating witness said that most did not receive their share, either because they were killed first or it was never given to them.</p><p>The papers say the co-operator wore a wire and recorded a conversation he had with Asaro in 2011 in which the pair discussed being slighted.</p><p>\"We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get,\" Asaro said, according to the court papers. \"Jimmy Burke kept everything.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427932601'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/24/1390557457362/Alleged-mobster-Vincent-A-006.jpg' alt='Alleged mobster Vincent Asaro charged over 1978 airport heist' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Vincent Asaro is escorted by FBI agents.

According to the co-operating witness, Asaro and Burke were business partners in Robert's Lounge. The saloon was described by a fellow Lucchese associate of Burke, the late Henry Hill, as Burke's private cemetery.</p><p>\"Jimmy buried over a dozen bodies … under the bocce courts,\" Hill wrote in his book A Goodfella's Guide to New York.</p><p>Katz once owned a warehouse where mobsters stored stolen goods, according to the court papers. After a raid at the warehouse, Asaro and Burke began to suspect Katz was a law enforcement informant.</p><p>Asaro told the co-operator that Burke \"had killed Katz with a dog chain because they believed he was a 'rat',\" the papers say. In the 1980s, Burke ordered the co-operator to dig up the remains and move them to another location.</p><p>The co-operator told investigators that Asaro and Burke had brought Katz's body to a vacant home in Queens where it was concealed beneath a cement floor.</p><p>Burke was the inspiration for Robert De Niro's character in Goodfellas, which was based on Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy and told the story of Hill's time in the mob and subsequent co-operation with law enforcement.</p><p>Massino was convicted in 2004 on charges that he had a hand in multiple gangland murders, including the execution of a mobster who vouched for the FBI undercover agent Donnie Brasco – a story that was also turned into a movie.</p><p>In July, Massino saw his life prison sentence reduced to time served, after prosecutors praised his work as a government co-operator.</p>","headline":"Alleged mobster Vincent Asaro charged over 1978 'Goodfellas' airport heist","trailText":"Asaro, 78, is accused of

Macmillan Cancer Support said some patients were being deemed as too old for treatment and were not assessed on their overall fitness.</p><p>Research from the charity and the National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) also found that tens of thousands of pensioners diagnosed with cancer have survived for at least a decade.</p><p>The figures showed more than 130,000 people in the UK have survived for at least 10 years after being diagnosed with cancer at the age of 65 or above. That number included more than 8,000 patients who were diagnosed at the age of 80 and over.</p><p>But despite the large number of older people who are \"long-term\" survivors of the disease, the charity said many patients in the UK are being denied treatment because they are deemed to be too old.</p><p>It said that cancer survival rates in this age group are \"poor\".</p><p>Macmillan pointed out that survival rates in the UK compared badly with those on the continent and warned of what it saw as a worrying trend in the way people are treated.</p><p>For many common cancers – including prostate, breast, lung, stomach, ovarian and kidney cancers – the UK and Ireland have a lower five-year survival rate than the rest of Europe, a spokesman said.</p><p>Health workers should ensure treatment decisions are not based on age alone and should also assess a patient's physical and mental well-being, the charity added.</p><p>\"It's wrong to write off older people as too old for treatment,\" said Macmillan's chief executive Ciaran Devane</p><p>\"With a proper assessment and appropriate treatment, our research shows that many older cancer patients can live for a long time and can even be cured.</p><p>\"While it's good news that so many older people are benefiting from treatment, many thousands more could live longer if our survival rates for over-65s matched those in comparable countries.</p><p>\"The barriers to getting treatment – which include age discrimination and inadequate assessment methods – must be tackled now so more older people can survive cancer and live for many years.\"</p><p>NCIN's clinical lead Dr Mick Peake added: \"It is vital that all patients receive the best and most effective treatment based on the nature of their cancer and their fitness for treatment and that chronological age alone is not the deciding&nbsp;factor.</p><p>\"We know that cancer survival rates in older patients in many other countries are better than in the UK and ensuring optimal treatment at all ages is the way of tackling this issue.\"</p><p>Dr Mark Porter, chairman of council at the British Medical Association, said: \"It is important that all healthcare professionals ensure that patients are treated on the basis of their clinical need.</p><p>\"With an increasingly ageing population, it should be a key part of medical professionalism to guarantee that older patients are treated with the care and respect they deserve.\"</p>","headline":"Older cancer patients being written off instead of treated, says charity","trailText":"<p>Macmillan

Following his release from prison because he did not have any children, nor was his offence against any, there would have been no requirement for the local authority to be alerted.</p><p>In 2006 there was an assessment by agencies concerning domestic violence against Mairead Philpott but this was \"explained away as insignificant by the family\" and treated as minor.</p><p>But the report added: \"However, if health staff had been aware at the time of the father's earlier conviction, it is likely that this incident would have been cause for greater concern and investigation.\"</p><p>It went on: \"Children's Social Care practice at this point here could and should have been more thorough, with checks being made on all the children's files, the police being contacted again for any information and further contact made with the health visitor to ask whether she had seen the two mothers.</p><p>\"It would however have been difficult to review all the siblings' files as records were kept on paper and would have had to have been manually retrieved.</p><p>\"It is not known why this did not happen but there were pressures to maintain the throughput of work and, as information had been obtained verbally before, it may have been considered that the social worker should move on to other more urgent cases.\"</p><p>The report also added that it would have been \"best practice\" for the social worker to have seen both mothers alone, but given the information available at the time it is likely any assessment would have been one of \"low risk\".</p><p>Overcrowding at the Victory Road property was considered by the report, especially after Mick Philpott had made numerous appeals in the media to get a bigger house from the local authority.</p><p>The review stated that there was no evidence at any time that there were health and safety issues relating to the number of children in the household and no concerns had ever been reported about fire safety in the home, which was fitted with working smoke alarms at the time of the fire.</p><p>The serious case review made a number of recommendations to various agencies, some of which it said have already been implemented, including ensuring multi-agency risk assessment conferences consider not just the victim, but all children who possibly remain at risk from the perpetrators.</p><p>Derby City Council said in a statement: \"When six children die in such tragic circumstances there is an expectation that the local safeguarding children board will review the work of the agencies involved, even if, as in this case, the children were not considered to be children in need.</p><p>\"Recommendations associated with council services relate to practice improvements, there being no causal link determined by this extensive and detailed review, between current practice and the tragic events that occurred.\"</p>","headline":"Philpott deaths 'not preventable', according to serious case

However, we want to be as transparent as possible, and perhaps in the past we have not been as open as we could have been,\" he said.</p><p>\"We want to reassure the public we are doing everything we can do prevent the misuse of the systems, with national standards and guidelines in place. ANPR is about helping the public to stay safe. I understand and respect people's concerns and I think we can address them.\"</p><p>But Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, raised concerns about the scale of the expansion of the system.\"ANPR is a classic example of a very intrusive technology being rolled out with zero public debate,\" he said.</p><p>The ANPR system has become a cornerstone of British policing over the past decade, but details of the number of cameras in operation, and the number of images on the database, are not publicly available.</p><p>The Home Office refused to give the figures to the Guardian or to detail how much police forces had spent on camera systems over the past three years.</p><p>However, the Guardian understands 46 forces in England and Wales have signed a memorandum committing themselves to share information to allow \"the full exploitation of ANPR at national regional and local levels\". Two images are taken of every vehicle – one focused on the numberplate, and a second of the whole car, which often includes the face of the driver. Details on the time of day and direction of travel are also kept.</p><p>The pictures can be kept for up to two years and cross-checked for \"hits\" against the Police National Computer and other \"hotlist\" databases, including the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Motor Insurers' Bureau.</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian, Blazeby, an assistant chief constable in Staffordshire, insisted ANPR was vital for counter-terror and organised crime operations for the simple reason that \"most criminals use the roads\".He said: \"There are myths about ANPR. It is actually a fairly basic technology and I am keen for police forces to maximise the use of it appropriately.\"</p><p>He admitted bulk databases such as ANPR and those held by insurance companies were becoming more important to the police. \"There are numerous databases available to help in fighting crime. One of our priorities is to develop ways in which we can more effectively analyse this data. We also want a system that we can harmonise with Europe, so that ANPR is developed with our European police and law enforcement partners. It is not so much the technology that is changing, but police are embracing the benefits of the technology. We are committed to ensuring that we only use ANPR cameras where they are necessary, and we need to further develop ways in which we are able to analyse the data to prevent and detect crime.\"</p><p>Blazeby said there were no plans to upgrade ANPR cameras with facial recognition technology, though he left the door ajar. \"I am never going to say never, but it is not in the pipeline at the moment and I do not see that changing in the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>Privacy campaigners said the expansion of ANPR was happening without proper scrutiny or debate, and raised concerns about which bodies have access to the vast amount of material on the NADC.</p><p>A police review of the system has also acknowledged serious flaws that are now being addressed.</p><p>Pickles, of <a href=\"http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Big Brother Watch</a>, said: \"The public hasn't been given even the most basic information about what information is being recorded, how long it is kept or who is able to access it. When you consider the system allows every journey to be tracked, down to the second, and for someone to search through the entire log of when your car was scanned and where, it is without doubt an extremely intrusive system. How many people would have said yes if they had been asked to install a device on their car so the police could monitor their journeys? Yet this is exactly what ANPR technology allows.\"</p><p>Pickles said ANPR was originally meant to record the details of cars that were already on a police watchlist. But forces had now begun recording every vehicle that passed one of the cameras.</p><p>\"It is a total failure of law and oversight if this massive yet secretive expansion is legal.\"</p><p>The campaign group No CCTV said the police were becoming more and more like an intelligence agency, gathering details about people's lives that it did not need to have.</p><p>\"The police talk about ANPR as if it is a magic bullet, and that they can't do without it,\" said a spokesman. \"But the truth is they are storing details about millions of innocent people, and it is not at all clear who has access to this data. There has been a huge shift in British policing that has gone almost unnoticed. They have become intelligence gatherers like the spy agencies.\"</p><p>The first ANPR cameras were introduced in 1984 on the M1 to help identify stolen vehicles. In 2005 the government approved a scheme to set up 2,000 fixed cameras nationwide and a data centre.</p><p>Camera numbers have increased steadily since then and the Metropolitan police has equipped more than 100 police cars with mobile camera units. Known as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyAoM27k4ng\" title=\"\">ANPR interceptors</a>, they were introduced two years ago to patrol central London, feeding information into<a href=\"http://content.met.police.uk/News/New-approach-to-ANPR-launched/1400012148405/1257246741786\" title=\"\"> a new bureau</a> at Scotland Yard.</p><p>Police enthusiasm for the technology has raised concerns over privacy, and the <a href=\"http://www.ico.org.uk/news/latest_news/2013/Police-use-of-Ring-of-Steel-is-disproportionate-and-must-be-reviewed-24072013\" title=\"\">Information Commissioner's Office slapped down Hertfordshire police last July </a>for introducing a \"ring of steel\" around Royston, saying it could see no reason why the force thought it necessary to have cameras monitoring all traffic in and out of the rural town 24 hours a day.</p><p>\"We hope that this enforcement notice sends a clear message to all police forces, that the use of ANPR cameras needs to be fully justified before they are installed,\" said Stephen Eckersley, the ICO's Head of Enforcement.</p><p>In 2010 a review criticised West Midlands police for spending £3m setting up 200 cameras in Muslim communities in Birmingham. The force apologised.</p><p>Last year the police acknowledged it had to work harder to justify the use of ANPR following three cases investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p><p>One looked at the murder in October 2009 of 17-year-old <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7398085/Ashleigh-Hall-one-mistake-cost-teenager-her-life.html\" title=\"\">Ashleigh Hall</a>; her killer, a known sex-offender, had been picked up six times by ANPR on the day of her disappearance, but the leads were not followed.</p><p>The IPCC warned that the ANPR system was being overused for minor issues and higher priority matters were being missed.</p><p>The suicide of <a href=\"http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Police-policy-change-M180-death/story-13334660-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Sean Toombs in October 2010</a> also caused concern. Toombs was arrested by Lincolnshire police on suspicion of rape after ANPR registered a \"hit\" on his car.</p><p>Officers tried to stop him again the following day because his details had not been immediately removed from the ANPR list. Toombs failed to stop and died in his car after setting fire to a petrol can.</p><p>An ACPO review of ANPR conducted last year concluded: \"Even completely innocent individuals can suffer the most serious consequences if ANPR is not accurate or not used or managed in an appropriate and managed way.\"In an effort to rebuild confidence in the technology, police have committed to abide by 14 \"golden rules\" to govern the use of ANPR.</p><p>Last month Acpo also launched <a href=\"http://www.police.uk/information-and-advice/automatic-number-plate-recognition/\" title=\"\">a website</a> to explain the benefits of the system.</p><p>A new Home Office code of practice states the cameras should only be used \"in pursuit of a legitimate aim\" and when it \"meets a pressing need\".</p><p>\"ANPR is a vital tool and we support its use where it is legitimate and proportionate,\" a spokesman said. \"We have created a new, independent post of surveillance camera commissioner to help oversee this. These cameras may only be located where there is an identified need to detect, deter, and disrupt criminality. Any new ANPR camera deployment will also require a privacy impact assessment.\"</p>","headline":"CCTV cameras on Britain's roads capture 26 million images every day","trailText":"Privacy activists

She said she lost count of the number of assailants, who she said included several of her neighbours.</p><p>Officials said medical investigations had backed the woman's claim of repeated rape by between five and 15 men.</p><p>\"Prima facie the woman was gang-raped by a group of villagers following a kangaroo court where she and her fiance were fined for their so-called extramarital relationship. A complaint was lodged with Labhpur police station against 13 persons. All the accused have been arrested,\" said the local police superintendent, Birbhum Sudhakar.</p><p>Witnesses in the village described how the woman was first raped on a bamboo platform in the centre of the small cluster of mud-walled huts surrounded by fields before being locked in a hut during the night where she was assaulted again.</p><p>\"She lost a lot of blood and remains in a critical condition. She only survived because she is very tough,\" said a senior medical official at the hospital where the victim is being treated.</p><p>The wife of the married mason with whom the victim had a relationship sold jewellery to pay his fine. The victim's family had no savings.</p><p>India has been hit by a wave of sexual violence – particularly gang-rapes – in recent years. Last week a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/danish-tourist-gang-raped-delhi-india\" title=\"\">51-year-old tourist in Delhi</a> was raped by at least five men who attacked while she was walking back to her hotel. There have been several other similar attacks on foreigners.</p><p>The gang-rape and murder of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/12/delhi-gang-rape-death-transformed-lives\" title=\"\">23-year-old Indian woman in Delhi in December 2012</a> prompted grief and outrage across the country, with thousands taking to the streets in protests demanding tougher laws, better policing and a shift in cultural&nbsp;attitudes.</p><p>The United Nations asked India, the world's second most populous country, to ensure security for women. But although prison terms for rape have been stiffened, stalking made a criminal offence and gender sensitivity programmes introduced for some police officers, little appears to have changed on the ground.</p><p>Birbhum is in West Bengal state, which appears to be a particular blackspot. Last month a worker at a gym was abducted and raped by five men in a truck.</p><p>In October a woman was raped twice by the same group of men, once as she returned from a police station where she had recorded a statement about the first attack, and was then set on fire. She died of her injuries.</p><p>West Bengal is governed by the Trinamool Congress party (TMC), which has been under fire for failing to halt the rising sexual violence. Its chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, is a firebrand political outsider and one of the most powerful women in India.</p><p>Derek O'Brien, a TMC parliamentarian, promised \"swift action … zero tolerance\", in a message on Twitter on Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/political-parties-condemn-gang-rape-of-tribal-girl-in-west-bengal-474631\" title=\"\">Opposition politicians</a> in West Bengal called the incident barbaric.</p><p>The attack has focused attention on the informal village councils and courts run by local male elders, which are common across much of rural India.</p><p>Although technically illegal, they are frequently responsible for inflicting cruel, sometimes lethal, punishments for supposed social transgressions such as marrying without prior consent. Such courts also frequently oblige relatives to take violent action to restore the \"honour\" of a community.</p><p>In one incident four years ago in Birbhum , village elders ordered tribal women to strip and walk naked in front of large crowds as a punishment for \"unauthorised\" relationships.</p><p>Manish Tewari, India's information minister, said in Delhi: \"In a democratic country, based upon the rule of law, no vigilantism can be permitted.\"</p><p>In the latest case, those arrested and the victim are from an <em>adivasi</em> or tribal community, who are among the poorest and most marginalised in India. West Bengal has social indicators that are worse than many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The council appears to have acted after finding the woman sitting with her lover under a tree. Following the attack, villagers threatened the badly injured victim and her family. Nearly 48 hours later, relatives managed to take her to a clinic from where she was transferred to a hospital. Only then were law enforcement agencies alerted.</p><p>The causes of the wave of sexual violence, and its extent, are hotly debated. Many commentators say it is a consequence of the efforts of a growing number of women, even in remote rural areas, to claim basic freedoms denied for centuries. Others point to India's acute gender imbalance, tenacious caste system, apathetic police, inefficient judiciary and entrenched patriarchal culture. Conservatives have blamed \"western influences\", women's clothing and even fast food.</p><p>Activists say that in India as few as one in 100 attacks are reported and counted in official records. Fear of social ostracism and of brutal, unsympathetic police limit the number of victims prepared to complain.</p><p>The 13 suspects in Birbhum were remanded in custody. Many villagers blamed the victim. \"We will never allow her or her family back here,\" said Panmuni Tudu, a housewife.</p>","headline":"Thirteen men in court over public gang-rape in Indian village","trailText":"Attack appears to have been ordered by village council as punishment for 'unauthorised' relationship and failure to pay fine","newspaperPageNumber":"19","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6v5","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390499871277/Gang-rape-in-Birbhum-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390499871277/Gang-rape-in-Birbhum-006.jpg","wordcount":"924","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427872974","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8598626","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jason Burke in Kolkata","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031728","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T18:01:08Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/court-gang-rape-indian-village-birbhum","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/court-gang-rape-indian-village-birbhum","tags":[{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/india","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jasonburke","webTitle":"Jason Burke","rcsId":"GNL001549","r2ContributorId":"15798","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/2/1267538178716/Jason-Burke.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jason Burke is the south Asia correspondent of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers.</p><p>In more than a decade as a staff correspondent with the papers Burke has reported on a wide range of subjects in countries from Algeria to Cambodia, from Uzebkistan to Zimbabwe. </p><p>Based in Pakistan from 1998 to 2002,  reporting from Afghanistan under the Taliban and during the war of 2001, he has returned to both Pakistan and Afghanistan many times since.

Baker said the test of engaging in \"conduct capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person\", which has long been used to secure court injunctions in noisy neighbour cases in social housing, would continue to be used and extended to the private housing sector, but would not be used as a general test.</p><p>Baker said: \"I have listened to what people said. We will be tabling amendments next Monday to the antisocial behaviour bill which accept Lord Dear's amendment.\"</p><p>He said he still believed the \"injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance\" – or Ipnas – would not have led to carol singers or bellringers being banned. Baker said it had never been the government's intention to prevent people exercising their freedom of speech or rights of protest.</p><p>But he added that there had been a very large vote in the House of Lords that was indicative of widespread concern.</p><p>The 128-vote defeat in the Lords came after Dear said anyone over the age of 10 could be served with an Ipna, it could last for an indefinite period of time, and it could lead to a prison sentence if breached.</p><p>A Labour former attorney general, Lord Morris, warned that \"nuisance and annoyance\" was such an elastic term it would catch all sorts of people who should not be before the courts. He argued that the \"harassment, alarm and distress\" yardstick had been well tested in the courts.</p><p>A disparate alliance of 11 charities and civil liberties groups, including Justice, the Christian Institute and the National Secular Society, had all written to the home secretary, Theresa May, urging her to accept Dear's amendment to clause 1 of the antisocial behaviour bill. They had warned it would clog up the courts with needless applications.</p><p>Dear's successful rebellion in the Lords had been supported by four former Metropolitan police commissioners, a former lord chancellor, a former director of public prosecutions and a former president of the supreme court.</p>","headline":"'Nuisance and annoyance' injunctions abandoned after Lords defeat","trailText":"<p>Critics said Asbo replacements could have criminalised peaceful protesters, carol singers and bellringers</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6xv","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390502201832/Norman-Baker-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390502201832/Norman-Baker-006.jpg","wordcount":"462","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427875848","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8598483","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alan Travis, home affairs editor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031750","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-30T18:38:05Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jan/23/nuisance-and-annoyance-injunctions-abandoned-lords-defeat","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/law/2014/jan/23/nuisance-and-annoyance-injunctions-abandoned-lords-defeat","tags":[{"id":"law/criminal-justice","webTitle":"UK criminal justice","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-justice","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/law/criminal-justice","references":[]},{"id":"society/asbos","webTitle":"Asbos","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/asbos","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/asbos","references":[]},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/communities","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/communities","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"politics/lords","webTitle":"House of Lords","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/lords","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alantravis","webTitle":"Alan Travis","rcsId":"GNL027519","r2ContributorId":"15315","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/26/alan_travis_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alan Travis is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/0,,584184,00.html\">home affairs</a> editor.
