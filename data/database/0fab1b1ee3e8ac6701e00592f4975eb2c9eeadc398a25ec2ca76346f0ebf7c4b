Asked whether Snowden was a&nbsp;whistleblower, he&nbsp;replied: “I prefer the term defendant. That’s the most apt title.”&nbsp;</p><p>The network said Holder made similar remarks at the University of Virginia, quoting him as saying: “We've always indicated that the notion of clemency isn't something that we were willing to consider. Instead, were he coming back to the US&nbsp;to enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers. ”</p><p>Snowden has never denied leaking the documents, but insisted his decision to provide top-secret documents to reporters working for the Guardian and Washington Post was an act of conscience, designed to inform the public about the nature of NSA surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the webchat, Snowden said he did not believe he would receive a fair trial in the US.&nbsp;\"The 100-year-old law under which I’ve been charged, which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest, and forbids a public interest defence,\" he said. \"This is especially frustrating, because it means there’s no chance to have a fair trial, and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury.\"</p><p>Snowden’s critics have argued that he is not a legitimate whistleblower because he did not take his concerns to intelligence inspectors general or members of Congress on the intelligence oversight committees.</p><p>A former NSA contractor with Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden defended his leaks in the live chat, pointing out that intelligence-community contractors are not covered by whistleblower&nbsp;protection laws.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If I had revealed what I knew about these unconstitutional but classified programs to Congress, they could have charged me with a felony.”</p><p>The whistleblower’s supporters argue out that he would unable to mount a proper defence in a US courtroom, in part because he would be barred from discussing the classified government programs.&nbsp;</p><p>A judge would also be likely to instruct the jury that Snowden’s intentions would&nbsp;not constitute a defence of the charges against him.&nbsp;Some scholars have said Holder should adapt the rules to recognise the unique nature of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Department of Justice and Snowden’s attorneys could agree to conduct it by a slightly different set of rules, rules that would permit the jury to consider the full extent of the alleged governmental wrongdoing he uncovered along with the full scope of his alleged crimes,” Alex Little, a former CIA analyst and assistant US attorney, wrote recently.</p><p>Holder’s remarks are the latest in a series of hints the administration might consider some kind of plea bargain with the former contractor. Such a move that would be deeply unpopular with intelligence officials and their supporters on Capitol Hill.</p><p>In remarks published six days ago, Obama appeared to leave the door open to some kind of arrangement with Snowden.&nbsp;</p><p>A 17,000-word <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/01/27/140127fa_fact_remnick\">New Yorker profile</a> of the the president, written by the magazine’s editor, David Remnick, quoted him as saying Snowden was &nbsp;“not akin to Watergate or some scandal in which there were coverups involved”. &nbsp;He also insisted “the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it”.</p><p>However, in remarks to Remnick the day before he gave last week's long-awaited speech on the NSA, Obama said: “I do not have a yes/no answer on clemency for Edward Snowden. This is an active case, where charges have been brought.”</p><p>Last month, Richard Ledgett, the NSA official in charge of assessing the alleged damage caused by Snowden’s leaks, raised the possibility of an amnesty in return for assurances that top-secret material could be secured.</p><p>“My personal view is, yes, it’s worth having a conversation about,” he told CBS News. “I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high. It would be more than just an assertion on his part.”</p><p>In Thursday’s webchat, Snowden also said a report by the government’s independent civil liberties watchdog, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, vindicated his actions. The divided board found that the bulk collection of Americans’ phone data was illegal and ought to end.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is simply no justification for continuing an unconstitutional policy with a 0% success rate,” Snowden said.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>","headline":"US hints at Edward Snowden plea bargain to allow return from Russia","trailText":"Attorney general prepared to 'engage in conversation' with NSA whistleblower&nbsp;but says full clemency is 'going too far'<br><br>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5tk","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390513517539/0d95c253-41e9-4db6-837d-f426bf6585b1-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390513517539/0d95c253-41e9-4db6-837d-f426bf6585b1-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427846230","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e11b03e4b065f7ddbb83aa","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Paul Lewis, Spencer Ackerman and Dan Roberts in Washington","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031500","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T22:31:01Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/edward-snowden-nsa-plea-bargain-russia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/edward-snowden-nsa-plea-bargain-russia","tags":[{"id":"world/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/edward-snowden","references":[]},{"id":"world/nsa","webTitle":"NSA","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/nsa","references":[]},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/russia","references":[]},{"id":"world/privacy","webTitle":"Privacy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/privacy","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/obama-administration","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-national-security","webTitle":"US national security","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-national-security","references":[]},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/surveillance","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/paullewis","webTitle":"Paul Lewis","r2ContributorId":"19990","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/21/1261414668260/paul_lewis.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Paul Lewis is Washington correspondent for the Guardian.

Security Agency’s mass collection of American phone data, saying the program defended by Obama last week was illegal and ought to be shut down.<br></p><p>A divided&nbsp;Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent and long-troubled liberties advocate in the executive branch,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2014/jan/23/privacy-civil-liberties-board-nsa-report-text\">issued a report on Thursday</a> that concludes the NSA’s collection of every US phone record on a daily basis violates the legal restrictions of the statute cited to authorize it, section 215 of the Patriot Act.<br></p><p>“This program should be ended, allowing for a transition period,” board member James Dempsey said Thursday.<br></p><p>The recommendations of the five-member board, which featured two dissenters, amount to the strongest criticism within the US government yet of the highly controversial surveillance program, first disclosed by the Guardian thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\">whistleblower Edward Snowden</a>. They give fresh support to congressional efforts at ending the practice on Capitol Hill –&nbsp;the main political battleground where the scope of surveillance will be readjusted this year. &nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2014/jan/23/privacy-civil-liberties-board-nsa-report-text\">report</a>, first published by&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/independent-review-board-says-nsa-phone-data-program-is-illegal-and-should-end/2014/01/22/4cebd470-83dd-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html\">Washington Post</a> and the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/us/politics/watchdog-report-says-nsa-program-is-illegal-and-should-end.html\"> New York Times</a>, the privacy board&nbsp;found that the mass phone data collection was at best marginally useful for US counter-terrorism, a finding that went further than similar assessments by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/14/nsa-review-panel-senate-phone-data-terrorism\">a federal judge</a> and Obama’s own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/14/nsa-review-panel-senate-phone-data-terrorism\">surveillance advisory board</a>.</p><p>Not only did the board conclude that the bulk surveillance was a threat to constitutional liberties, it could not find “a single instance” in which the program “made a concrete difference in the outcome of a terrorism investigation”.<br></p><p>“Moreover, we are aware of no instance in which the program directly contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown terrorist plot or the disruption of a terrorist attack.” &nbsp;</p><p>During a live Q&amp;A on the Free Snowden website on Thursday, Snowden called for the White House to end the program, citing the report's estimate that the NSA's searches of 300 phone numbers in 2012 resulted in 120 million phone numbers being placed into its storehouse of searched data.</p><p>Describing Obama’s decision to deliver his NSA reform speech last week ahead of the privacy board report’s publication as “interesting”, he said: “When even the federal government says the NSA violated the constitution at least 120 million times under a single program, but failed to discover even a single ‘plot’, it’s time to end ‘bulk collection’, which is a euphemism for mass surveillance. There is no simply justification for continuing an unconstitutional policy with a 0% success rate.”</p><p>The board tacitly rejected the NSA’s public claim that the bulk phone records collection may have made the difference in stopping a terrorist plot connected to cab drivers in San Diego&nbsp;–&nbsp;a rare case in which a government review body has specifically refuted the NSA’s aggressive post-Snowden PR campaign.<br></p><p>“We believe that in only one instance over the past seven years has the program arguably contributed to the identification of an unknown terrorism suspect. Even in that case, the suspect was not involved in planning a terrorist attack and there is reason to believe that the FBI may have discovered him without the contribution of the NSA’s program,” it found.<br></p><p>The privacy board&nbsp;did not castigate the NSA. Its report said the NSA had not acted “in bad faith”, nor had it seen evidence of government misconduct. But it said that the documented incidences of the NSA exceeding its court-ordered mandates resulted from the program’s “technical complexity” and illustrated the “risks inherent in such a program”.&nbsp;</p><p>But the board dramatically sought to illustrate the implications on US privacy of the process NSA uses to query the phone when it has “reasonable articulable suspicion” of a connection to terrorism. While the NSA has said, and the privacy board affirmed, that most collected phone data is never examined by the agency, the fact that its analysts examined the call patterns of 300 numbers in 2012 meant that its “corporate store” of searched data “would contain records involving over 120 million phone numbers”.</p><p>Obama endorsed moving the bulk phone records collection out of the NSA’s hands and into those of a private entity, whose contours he left undefined in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/obama-nsa-reforms-end-storage-americans-call-data\">Friday speech</a>, his most extensive remarks on the surveillance to date.&nbsp;<br><b></b></p><p>But Obama accepted the intelligence community’s highly contested rationale that bulk phone records collection was necessary in order for the government to detect domestic connections to terrorism.&nbsp;“I believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved,” Obama said.</p><p>National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Thursday that the White House disagreed with the privacy board's&nbsp;assessment of the program’s legality.</p><p><br></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f88645eb-2656-4276-8c6d-183c86d484f4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390494207496/1e0c8a55-efe4-4f79-83a2-734a59852f77-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Obama at Justice Department\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>President Obama speaks about the National Security Agency and intelligence agencies surveillance techniques. Photograph: Jim&nbsp;Watson/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>“Consistent with the recent holdings of the United States district courts for the southern district of New York and southern district of California, as well as the findings of 15 judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on 36 separate occasions over the past seven years, the administration believes that the program is lawful. As the president has said though, he believes we can and should make changes in the program that will give the American people greater confidence in it,” Hayden said.</p><p>The privacy board, which briefed Obama on its findings before his speech last week, recommends instead that the bulk collection ought to be ended outright, owing to its assessed lack of necessity and dubious legality.</p><p>Under the privacy board's&nbsp;recommendation, federal agencies would be able to obtain phone and other records under court orders in cases containing an individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. But there would be no storehouse, private or public, of telephone data beyond what the phone companies keep in the course of their normal business activities.</p><p>That recommendation, which goes further than the one issued by Obama’s surveillance advisory board, bolsters a bipartisan bill in the House and Senate, called the USA Freedom Act, which aims to decisively end bulk domestic data collection.</p><p>But the privacy board&nbsp;assessment drew its own rebuke from Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, a former FBI agent and chairman of the House intelligence committee.</p><p>“I am disappointed that three members of the board decided to step well beyond their policy and oversight role and conducted a legal review of a program that has been thoroughly reviewed,” Rogers said in a pre-dawn statement that castigated the privacy board&nbsp;for going “outside its expertise” in criticizing the utility of the bulk phone data collection.</p><p>“As those of us with law enforcement experience know, successful investigations use all available tools –&nbsp;there often is no ‘silver bullet’ that alone thwarts a plot,” Rogers said.&nbsp;The White House did not have an initial reaction.</p><p>Two of the board members, Rachel L&nbsp;Brand and Elisebeth Collins Cook, both lawyers in the George&nbsp;Bush-era Justice Department, dissented on the finding that the bulk phone data collection was illegal.</p><p>“The government’s interpretation of the statute is reasonable and was made in good faith,” said Brand, who said she feared that public dissatisfaction with the surveillance revelations would contribute to a “pendulum swing” in policy that might handicap the NSA’s legitimate spying activities.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The three other members –&nbsp;chairman David Medine, retired federal judge Patricia Wald, and civil liberties advocate James X Dempsey –&nbsp;rejected the government’s argument, reaffirmed for years by a secret surveillance court, that the mass phone records collection was justified under a section of the Patriot Act that permits the government to amass records “relevant” to a terrorism inquiry.</p><p><br></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b740874b-2ef2-45fb-ab53-1e541cc71593\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390494237710/556147b6-1b04-465f-b23f-4c064290a4ac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Rogers of Michigan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Mike Rogers of Michigan. Photograph: AP</figcaption> </figure> <p>But the board’s majority found that bulk collection could not be “relevant” to such an investigation “without redefining the word relevant in a manner that is circular, unlimited in scope, and out of step with the case law from analogous legal contexts involving the production of records”.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The board found that such widespread and suspicionless data collection could have a “chilling effect” on Americans’ constitutional rights. Its conclusion echoed Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, who has likened the metadata collection to a “human relations database”.</p><p>The PCLOB found unanimity on a proposal, supported by many in Congress, to create a bar of special civil liberties advocates before the Fisa court in exceptional cases, and in doubting Obama’s proposal to transition the bulk collection to a private entity would resolve either the privacy or the security concerns inherent.</p><p>“I would have concerns with counting on the providers to hold the records as an adequate substitute,” Cook said. </p><p>“The same amount of information would likely not be available, and less and less would likely be available over time. Companies do not want this, and I am hard-pressed to see how this would help with their customers’ concerns. I think the end result will be significant pressure to impose a data-retention requirement, which potentially poses more threats to privacy.”</p><p>Dempsey said that Obama “didn’t answer the question of what does the new program look like, he kicked that down the road. And he in my view hasn’t fully grappled with the statute that is currently on the books and currently the basis for the program doesn’t fit with the way the program is being operated. … It is not clear whether he fully appreciated the need to go back to some basics.” </p><p>Civil libertarians greeted the privacy board's&nbsp;report as a vindication, particularly after the Obama speech fell short of their expectations.<br><b></b></p><p>“The board’s report makes even clearer that the government’s surveillance policies, as well as our system of oversight, are in need of far-reaching reform. The release of this long-awaited report should spur immediate action by both the administration and Congress,” said ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer.<br></p><p>Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the judiciary committee and co-authored the USA Freedom Act, said the report added to “the growing chorus” that wanted to end the phone metadata dragnet.<br></p><p>“The report reaffirms the conclusion of many that the Section 215 bulk phone records program has not been critical to our national security, is not worth the intrusion on Americans’ privacy, and should be shut down immediately,” Leahy said.<br></p><p>Leahy’s partner in the House, Wisconsin Republican James Sensenbrenner, said that the report “adds to the growing momentum behind genuine legislative reforms” and said it is “up to Congress to rein in abuse and restore trust in our intelligence community”.</p><p>Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat on the intelligence committee, predicted the report would spell “the final end of the government's bulk collection of telephone metadata”.<br><b></b></p><p>The board&nbsp;is not finished with its assessment of NSA surveillance. It plans in the coming weeks to issue another report evaluating the NSA’s collection of bulk foreign Internet communications, which have included those with Americans “incidentally” collected.<br><b></b></p><p>It also amounts to the first major test of the board, created in 2004 as a post-9/11 reform. A decade’s&nbsp;worth of problems with independence, member vacancies and other issues meant the privacy board&nbsp;did not functionally operate until 2013, when it was unexpectedly confronted by the Snowden revelations.</p><p>Chairman Medine told the Guardian last&nbsp;Thursday that he felt the privacy board rose to the challenge, even though Obama’s speech preceded its own report, a White House decision that raised eyebrows in the civil liberties community.</p><p>“I &nbsp;believe we’ve risen to the task, and are demonstrating both in the United States and around the world that the United States has a vigorous oversight body that will take a close look at these programs, have full access to them, and will be able to advise whether the programs do strike the right balance,”&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/nsa-surveillance-privacy-board-denies-being-sidelined-by-obama\">Medine said</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The White House, which&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/21/privacy-civil-liberties-obama-secretive\">set up the privacy board with hand-picked members of Washington's establishment</a>, distanced itself from the report&nbsp;on Thursday, particularly on the lawfulness and effectiveness of bulk collection.</p><p>“On the issue of 215, we simply disagree with the board's analysis on the legality of the programme,” said press secretary Jay Carney.<br></p><p>“Consistent with the recent holdings of the US district courts of the southern district of New York and southern district of California as well as the finding of 15 judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court on 36 separate occasions over the past seven years, the administration believes the programme is lawful.”<br></p><p>However the administration insisted its decision to announce Obama's review conclusions before publication of the privacy board report did not mean he had not listened to them.<br></p><p>“The president and

The candidate was not named in the indictment.&nbsp;</p><p>Attempts to reach D'Souza and a lawyer representing him were unsuccessful.</p><p>D'Souza was charged in the indictment with one count of making illegal contributions in the names of others, and one count of causing false statements to be made.&nbsp;In 2012, federal law limited primary and general election campaign contributions to $2,500 each, for a total of $5,000, from any individual to any one candidate.</p><p>\"As we have long said, this office and the FBI take a zero tolerance approach to corruption of the electoral process,\" the US attorney for Manhattan, Preet Bharara, said in a statement released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

a government building in response to opposition calls to observe a truce with riot police after long talks with President Viktor Yanukovych ended without a major breakthrough.</p><p>Early on Friday, the protesters broke into the Ministry of Agricultural Policy building in central Kiev, meeting no resistance. The move followed the seizure of local governors' offices in several western regions on Thursday.</p><p>The government's failure to grant key concessions was met with anger by thousands of protesters manning the barricades in the capital on Thursday evening, while the anti-government protests that have rocked Ukraine spread to other parts of the country during the day.</p><p>On Wednesday, after three people had been killed in clashes with riot police, the opposition politician Vitali Klitschko had asked protesters in central Kiev to observe an eight-hour truce while talks went on. Klitschko had promised to \"go on the attack\" if Yanukovych did not launch snap elections within 24 hours, while Arseniy Yatsenyuk, of the Fatherland party, said he was ready to take a \"bullet in the head\".</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-427874550\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/01/23/140123Ukraine-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/01/23/140123Ukraine_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/01/23/140123Ukraine/140123Ukraine.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/01/23//140123Ukraine.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/01/23/140123Ukraine_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>The protesters duly extinguished the flaming barricade of tyres that had been set up on the frontline, and the two sides stood facing each other down, the carcasses of burned out police buses between them. But when the trio of opposition leaders emerged after gruelling talks with the president that lasted more than four hours, they had changed their tune, asking for more time and a continuation of the ceasefire.</p><p>\"The only thing we were able to achieve was not much,\" a grim Klitschko told the crowd. He was booed by some of those at the barricade as he asked for a truce.</p><p>On Independence Square, the nationalist leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, who was part of the negotiations, put the idea of continuing discussions with the president to a midnight vote among the crowd, and it was overwhelmingly rejected. There are now difficult decisions to make for the opposition leaders, who have been unable to achieve their key demand of snap elections from Yanukovych but are uneasy about being held responsible for any further violence.</p><p>There were dramatic developments in the west of the country on Thursday as hundreds of people forced their way into the office of the regional governor in the city of Lviv, and forced him to sign a resignation letter. Oleh Salo, a Yanukovych appointee in a city where support for the president is in the low single digits, later said he signed the letter under duress and was rescinding his resignation.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427914385'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390504426177/056ddf78-5dcb-4767-bb46-1b611dba7b70-460x306.jpeg' alt='Ukrainian riot policemen stand in formation in central Kiev following clashes with pro-EU protesters.

health reforms and spending, s<a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/assets/video/widget/widget.html?vid=n45489\">aid on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that he was not about to give up red wine and cigarettes</a> to be president.&nbsp;</p><p>Asked by Leno whether he ever thought of running for president, Boehner replied, \"No.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I like to play golf. I like to cut my own grass,\" said Boehner, the top Republican in Congress. <br></p><p>\"I do drink red wine. I smoke cigarettes. And I'm not giving that up to be president of the United States.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Boehner also told Leno he and&nbsp; Obama \"get along fine\" despite their political differences.&nbsp;</p><p>\"But the country's gotten more partisan. So as a result the Congress has gotten more divided and there's less common ground,\" Boehner said.&nbsp;</p><p>Asked by Leno if the infighting in his own party was as bad as he had ever seen it, Boehner said, \"Oh, no,\" before adding with a smile, 'Well, maybe it is. It's bad.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Since early 2011, Boehner has fought with conservative Tea Party Republicans in the House, mainly over deficit-reduction tactics. The government shutdown in October further frayed relations with right-wing groups.&nbsp;</p><p>\"The funny thing about the so-called infighting is we agree on all the goals,\" said Boehner. \"We think Obamacare is bad for the country.

Muallem says he will leave Geneva unless 'serious' talks begin by Saturday, as UN mediator meets both sides separately","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T12:07:13Z","body":"<p>Long-awaited direct peace talks between the Syrian government and rebels fighting to overthrow President&nbsp;Bashar al-Assad&nbsp;failed to get under way as expected on Friday morning after Damascus insisted on ending \"terrorism\" before seeking a political solution to end nearly three years of war and misery.</p><p>UN mediator Lakhdar Brahimi was meeting both sides separately in Geneva for the second consecutive day to iron out procedural and agenda issues before a first round of negotiations at the Palais des Nations.</p><p>But Walid Muallem, Syria's foreign minister and head of its delegation, raised the stakes by warning that he would return to Damascus unless serious talks began by Saturday, Syrian state TV reported.</p><p>Face-to-face talks were due to carry on from where Wednesday's 40-nation international conference in nearby Montreux left off. It would be the first direct contact between the opposing parties since the anti-Assad uprising began in March 2011. An estimated 130,000 people have been killed since then, two million Syrians have fled abroad and nine million in all are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>Angry remarks in Montreux by Muallem left the western-backed Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) claiming that it alone was committed to the 2012 agreement – known as Geneva I – to create a \"transitional governing body\". Assad, president since succeeding his father in 2000, has insisted repeatedly that he will not step down. The opposition says he must go. Brahimi's problem is how to square that circle</p><p>Ahmed al-Jarba, the SOC president, said on Thursday: \"The Syrian revolution has achieved recognition internationally. The world has seen a people who were refused their rights for 40 years by a criminal and his family. When the people opposed him they were hit by chemical weapons. Bullets are their only answer to the voice of freedom. This regime is dead.\"</p><p>Muallem warned, however, that the SOC did not represent the opposition. He said efforts to achieve a political result were premature. The priority was \"to fight terrorism and this paves the way for the start of the political process\", he said, according to Syria's state news agency.</p><p>The propaganda and spin intensified in advance of the talks, with the opposition performing better than before – and far better than the Syrian government – with the assistance of strategic communications advisers provided by the British government and other western backers.</p><p>Many predict that the Brahimi talks are doomed to fail as the Syrian protagonists will prove unable to agree on a transition – as stipulated in the Geneva I communique, \"by mutual consent\" – or to overcome their intense mutual loathing. Shaaban scorned the opposition delegation in Montreux as American puppets. Muallem called them \"terrorists and traitors\".</p><p>The SOC has suffered from grave internal divisions and poor credibility. It faces stiff resistance from Islamist fighting groups and activists in Syria who insist there is no point in negotiating with Assad. To counter this, it is advertising an effort to include representatives of the Free Syrian Army and the newly created Syrian Revolutionary Front on its team.</p><p>It is also emphasising that only these forces are capable of fighting the al-Qaida-linked groups, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Jabhat al-Nusra. The SOC accuses the government of colluding with extremists to bolster the narrative that Syria faces a choice between Assad or al-Qaida.</p><p>\"Assad attempts to present himself as a credible partner on counter-terrorism,\" said Oubai Shahbandar, an opposition adviser. \"We want to use Geneva to turn the tables and show the world that we are the solution to fighting al-Qaida.\"</p><p>Al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, appealed on Thursday for an end to fighting \"between the holy warriors of Islam\" and urged them to concentrate on \"bringing down Assad's secular, sectarian, unjust and criminal regime to set up a just Islamic state\".</p><p>An estimated 1,400 people have died in internecine clashes this year.</p><p>Haitham al-Maleh, a veteran democracy activist, said he believed international pressure would eventually force a solution. \"We will succeed and the regime will be finished,\" Maleh said. \"It's clear that even Russia believes that Bashar al-Assad can't be part of the future.\"</p><p>Naim Kosayyer, of the Syrian Association for the Rights of Detainees and the Disappeared, said of the negotiations: \"So far the regime has only been talking to other countries. Now they will be speaking to Syrians – and Syrians will know how to respond in their own way.\"</p><p>Samir al-Taqi, an independent political scientist and opposition sympathiser, said: \"The Geneva process won't work by itself and the regime will not be knocked out in one blow. It will be defeated through the gradual erosion of the state. But the talks are another battlefield.\"</p><p>Western diplomats admit they do not have a clear idea of how the negotiations will pan out and how Brahimi will take things forward. The UN mediator has said he has \"indications\" of readiness for confidence-building measures, such as a ceasefire or prisoner exchanges. \"This conflict will only end by a political solution,\" one senior official said. \"But it's possible that Geneva II can't deliver it.\"</p>","headline":"Syria's foreign minister threatens to walk out of peace talks","trailText":"Walid Muallem says he will leave Geneva unless 'serious' talks begin by Saturday, as UN mediator meets both sides separately","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6ah","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562791120/Syrias-foreign-minister-W-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562791120/Syrias-foreign-minister-W-006.jpg","wordcount":"825","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427925638","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601134","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ian Black in Geneva and agencies","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032010","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:27:01Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/syrian-face-to-face-peace-talks-break-down","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/syrian-face-to-face-peace-talks-break-down","tags":[{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/syria","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ianblack","webTitle":"Ian Black","rcsId":"GNL014381","r2ContributorId":"15738","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/ian_black_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ian Black is the Guardian's Middle East editor.

By Thursday's close, it was at 8 to the dollar. On the black market, where Argentina's currency is even weaker, the peso dropped 6 percent Thursday to 13 per dollar.</p><p>The sharp depreciation is likely due to a new government strategy of seeking a sudden devaluation instead of a gradual one, said Juan Pablo Ronderos of economic consulting firm abeceb.com.</p><p>\"There was a first sign of this change on Tuesday because the central bank didn't show up (to intervene) until midday, and on Wednesday and today it just disappeared from the market,\" Ronderos said. \"The gradual devaluation wasn't working because the central bank kept on sacrificing lots of its reserves and it kept on being reflected on consumer prices.\"</p><p>Analysts expect Argentina's inflation to reach more than 30 percent this year, the second highest rate in Latin America after Venezuela.</p><p>\"The sharp drop will aggravate inflation, although the impact may be mitigated by the fact that some imports will already be purchased at the much weaker black market exchange rate,\" Neil Shearing, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics in London, said in a research note.</p><p>\"The bigger picture, though, is that the economic mismanagement of the past decade has once again pushed the country to the brink of a balance of payments crisis,\" Shearing wrote.</p><p>Critics of the left-leaning government of President Cristina Kirchner blame economic problems on its higher spending on social programs, expansion of business regulation and nationalisation of some companies.</p><p>Argentina has been kept from global credit markets since defaulting on its debt during its 2001-2002 financial crisis. So officials have been trying to keep dollars in the country for the central bank to use to pay off government debts.</p><p>But the bank's reserves have plunged to $29 billion, the lowest level in more than seven years despite increasingly restrictive currency controls meant to stem capital flight.</p><p>The controls make it nearly impossible to legally trade pesos for dollars, but many Argentines have turned to black market money changers to obtain dollars.</p><p>Many in the country are haunted by memories of the financial crisis, when banks froze deposits and the currency lost value, and they want dollars to keep in emergency stashes.</p>","headline":"Argentinian peso in freefall as economic crisis deepens","trailText":"Currency falls at fastest rate since 2002 collapse as central bank runs out of reserves to enter market<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m657","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527110343/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527110343/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427898589","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e1be76e4b065f7ddbb840b","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Reuters in Buenos Aires","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031865","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T01:34:52Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/argentinian-peso-freefall-economic-crisis-deepens","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/argentinian-peso-freefall-economic-crisis-deepens","tags":[{"id":"world/argentina","webTitle":"Argentina","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/argentina","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/currencies","references":[]},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/americas","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-b3b9f58f-adb9-4930-8bc6-e63dc2fc848a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527109834/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527109834/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-220x132.jpeg","source":"AP","photographer":"Victor R.

The report said two black 4x4s had blocked Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach, which “facilitated an open road” that enabled Bieber and Sharieff to race.<br></p><p>When the arrested officer attempted to stop Bieber, the singer inquired: “Why the fuck are you doing this?”<br></p><p>Bieber continued to ask: “What the fuck did I do? Why did you stop me?” He is reported to have assured the officer later: “I ain’t got no fucking weapons.”<br></p><p>The police report said there was “an odor of alcohol emanating” from Bieber’s breath. The 19-year-old, who is popular among younger teenagers and has about 47m followers on Twitter, reportedly had a “flushed face [and] bloodshot eyes”. Martinez said Bieber had admitted taking “prescription medication and that he had been smoking marijuana and that he did consume a beer”.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1ae3a006-f6ce-4cf0-9298-634fbbf16362\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390508399356/d9211748-fe83-4f51-ac2e-5c5268f4cafa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"R&B singer Khalil Sharieff is shown in booking photos provided by the Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Department.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>R&amp;B singer Khalil Sharieff's booking photos.

Police raided his house in a gated community in Calabasas, a celebrity enclave about 30 miles north-west of central Los Angeles, in search of evidence after allegations that the eggs caused thousands of dollars worth of damage.&nbsp;</p><p>Bieber is also being sued by a former bodyguard who says the singer repeatedly berated him, hit him in the chest and owes him more than $420,000 in overtime and other wages.

It was greeted by cheers from regional mediators and diplomats, and was welcomed in Washington.</p><p>President Barack Obama welcomed the ceasefire but said leaders needed to work to resolve the underlying causes of the conflict, and must quickly release political detainees.</p><p>\"South Sudan's leaders must demonstrate their sustained commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis,\" Obama said in a statement.</p><p>\"They have an obligation to ensure that the lives of their people and future of their young country are not further marred by continued violence, and that individuals who have committed atrocities are held to account.\" </p><p>The pact, which marks the first significant breakthrough since a power struggle between Kiir and Machar turned to violence on 15 December, is expected to be implemented within 24 hours of the signing, mediators said. The government also reportedly agreed to release 11 officials close to Machar from detention, a major point of dispute, although no time frame was given.</p><p>Taban Deng, head of the rebel delegation, said he hoped the deal would \"pave the way for a serious national political dialogue aiming at reaching a lasting peace in South Sudan\".</p><p>Government negotiator Nhial Deng Nhial said the talks, which began in Addis Ababa three weeks ago, were \"not easy\". \"We hope to be able to make haste towards an agreement that will end bloodshed,\" he was quoted as saying by AFP.</p><p>But it remains to be seen whether all fighters in South Sudan, a patchwork of rival militias with competing loyalties, will abide by the outcome.</p><p>\"What worries us is whether the agreement on the cessation of hostilities will stick [and] the capacity of the rebel group … to stop fighting,\" Deng said. \"We would like to take this opportunity to urge the rebel group to heed the voice of reason and abandon the quest for political power through violence.\"</p><p>His concern was echoed by a spokesman for the South Sudan's military, who cautioned that a group known as the \"white army\" may not want peace.</p><p>\"Riek Machar has been using that force to fight the SPLA [Sudan People's Liberation Army], so we have to see what will happen,\" Colonel Philip Aguer told the Associated Press. \"Civilians, innocents are dying, so it is good for the people of South Sudan to have peace.\"</p><p>After initial clashes broke out in the presidential guard five weeks ago, the conflict rapidly escalated into war between the regular army, backed by Ugandan troops, and breakaway units and other militia. It also took on an ethnic character as members of Kiir's Dinka tribe clashed with Machar's Nuer group. Some analysts say as many as 10,000 people have died, while close to half a million have been displaced.</p><p>The UN has said it is investigating widespread reports of atrocities and war crimes, including massacres, rapes, summary executions and the use of child soldiers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/south-sudan-soldiers-united-nations-compound-shelter-civilians\" title=\"\">It says 76,000 civilians are under protection at eight of its bases</a>.</p><p>The fighting has also affected South Sudan's oil industry, after technical workers fled and rebel fighters took control for while of the fields.</p><p>Earlier this week government forces recaptured the town of Malakal in the oil-producing Upper Nile state and the last major settlement under rebel control. Large numbers of rebel forces, however, are still massed in rural areas and smaller towns.</p><p>\"To the parties, we say, 'Enough,'\" Alexander Rondos, the EU special representative for the Horn of Africa, said at the signing of the deal on Thursday. \"The killing must end now. The displaced must be able to return to their homes.\"</p><p>The US, which spent billions of dollars helping South Sudan achieve independence in July 2011, also welcomed the deal. The White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \"This is a first critical step in ending the violence … we expect both parties to fully and swiftly implement the agreement.</p><p>\"The United States urges both sides to build on this momentum by moving swiftly to an inclusive political dialogue.\"</p><p>Others sounded a note of caution. Seyoum Mesfin, the chief mediator in Addis Ababa, told the ceremony: \"The crisis that gripped South Sudan is a mere manifestation of the challenges that face the young and fledgling state.</p><p>\"I believe that the postwar challenges will be greater than the war itself. The process will be ... unpredictable and delicate.\"</p><p>There was also scepticism on the streets of Juba, the South Sudanese capital. \"It can solve some of the immediate problems but not all the problems,\" Samuel Kuir Chok, 31, told Reuters. \"I'm not optimistic … because this guy [Machar)] wants to be president at all costs.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.enoughproject.org\" title=\"\">The Enough Project</a>, a US-based advocacy group, said Thursday's deal is only the first step on a long road to a sustainable peace.</p><p>\"If an inclusive peace process is not constructed that seeks to address root causes, the conflict will continue, with deadly consequences,\" said John Prendergast, the group's co-founder, adding it was \"far from guaranteed\" that all combatants would lay down arms just because a deal was signed in Ethiopia.</p><p>José Barahona, Oxfam's country director for South Sudan, added: \"The world's newest nation, plagued by conflict for the past month, has today been given a second chance. With the cessation of hostilities, the focus must now be on rapid reconciliation to aide a fast recovery and set South Sudan on a clear path to development.\" <strong> </strong></p><p>The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, welcomed the agreement, and said both sides must now ensure their forces stop fighting within 24 hours, as stipulated.</p><p>He said: \"The brutal violence of the last month has led to countless deaths and caused thousands of innocent people to endure unimaginable suffering.</p><p>\"The government and opposition must ensure that their forces implement the agreement immediately and in full.</p><p>\"It is now vital that both sides work to heal the divisions that led to this conflict, and to strengthen governance in South Sudan. A genuinely inclusive process of national reconciliation is now needed, to give the people of South Sudan confidence that such violence can never reoccur. The UK is ready to lend its full support to these efforts in South Sudan.</p><p>\"I fully support the African Union's decision to establish a commission of inquiry into alleged crimes committed during the conflict, and call on all sides to co-operate with it to ensure that those responsible for abuses are held accountable.\"\".</p>","headline":"South Sudan ceasefire deal signed","trailText":"<p>Agreement hailed as first step to ending conflict, though  doubts remain and Obama says political detainees must be released</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6v6","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390500349384/South-Sudanese-refugees-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390500349384/South-Sudanese-refugees-006.jpg","wordcount":"1080","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427873292","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8599145","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"David Smith, Africa correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031729","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T18:06:29Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/south-sudan-ceasefire-deal-signed","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/south-sudan-ceasefire-deal-signed","tags":[{"id":"world/south-sudan","webTitle":"South Sudan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/south-sudan","references":[]},{"id":"world/ethiopia","webTitle":"Ethiopia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ethiopia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/ethiopia","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidsmith","webTitle":"David Smith","rcsId":"GNL508721","r2ContributorId":"15571","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/6/1331034359272/David_Smith.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Smith is the Guardian's Africa correspondent</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidsmith","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/international","webTitle":"International","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/international","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427904108","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390500342052/South-Sudanese-refugees-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","altText":"South Sudanese refugees","height":"54","credit":"EPA","caption":"South Sudanese refugees in Joda, Sudan.

She only survived because she is very tough,\" said a senior medical official at the hospital where the victim is being treated.</p><p>The wife of the married mason with whom the victim had a relationship sold jewellery to pay his fine. The victim's family had no savings.</p><p>India has been hit by a wave of sexual violence – particularly gang-rapes – in recent years. Last week a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/danish-tourist-gang-raped-delhi-india\" title=\"\">51-year-old tourist in Delhi</a> was raped by at least five men who attacked while she was walking back to her hotel. There have been several other similar attacks on foreigners.</p><p>The gang-rape and murder of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/12/delhi-gang-rape-death-transformed-lives\" title=\"\">23-year-old Indian woman in Delhi in December 2012</a> prompted grief and outrage across the country, with thousands taking to the streets in protests demanding tougher laws, better policing and a shift in cultural&nbsp;attitudes.</p><p>The United Nations asked India, the world's second most populous country, to ensure security for women. But although prison terms for rape have been stiffened, stalking made a criminal offence and gender sensitivity programmes introduced for some police officers, little appears to have changed on the ground.</p><p>Birbhum is in West Bengal state, which appears to be a particular blackspot. Last month a worker at a gym was abducted and raped by five men in a truck.</p><p>In October a woman was raped twice by the same group of men, once as she returned from a police station where she had recorded a statement about the first attack, and was then set on fire. She died of her injuries.</p><p>West Bengal is governed by the Trinamool Congress party (TMC), which has been under fire for failing to halt the rising sexual violence. Its chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, is a firebrand political outsider and one of the most powerful women in India.</p><p>Derek O'Brien, a TMC parliamentarian, promised \"swift action … zero tolerance\", in a message on Twitter on Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/political-parties-condemn-gang-rape-of-tribal-girl-in-west-bengal-474631\" title=\"\">Opposition politicians</a> in West Bengal called the incident barbaric.</p><p>The attack has focused attention on the informal village councils and courts run by local male elders, which are common across much of rural India.</p><p>Although technically illegal, they are frequently responsible for inflicting cruel, sometimes lethal, punishments for supposed social transgressions such as marrying without prior consent. Such courts also frequently oblige relatives to take violent action to restore the \"honour\" of a community.</p><p>In one incident four years ago in Birbhum , village elders ordered tribal women to strip and walk naked in front of large crowds as a punishment for \"unauthorised\" relationships.</p><p>Manish Tewari, India's information minister, said in Delhi: \"In a democratic country, based upon the rule of law, no vigilantism can be permitted.\"</p><p>In the latest case, those arrested and the victim are from an <em>adivasi</em> or tribal community, who are among the poorest and most marginalised in India. West Bengal has social indicators that are worse than many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The council appears to have acted after finding the woman sitting with her lover under a tree. Following the attack, villagers threatened the badly injured victim and her family. Nearly 48 hours later, relatives managed to take her to a clinic from where she was transferred to a hospital. Only then were law enforcement agencies alerted.</p><p>The causes of the wave of sexual violence, and its extent, are hotly debated. Many commentators say it is a consequence of the efforts of a growing number of women, even in remote rural areas, to claim basic freedoms denied for centuries. Others point to India's acute gender imbalance, tenacious caste system, apathetic police, inefficient judiciary and entrenched patriarchal culture. Conservatives have blamed \"western influences\", women's clothing and even fast food.</p><p>Activists say that in India as few as one in 100 attacks are reported and counted in official records. Fear of social ostracism and of brutal, unsympathetic police limit the number of victims prepared to complain.</p><p>The 13 suspects in Birbhum were remanded in custody. Many villagers blamed the victim. \"We will never allow her or her family back here,\" said Panmuni Tudu, a housewife.</p>","headline":"Thirteen men in court over public gang-rape in Indian village","trailText":"Attack appears to have been ordered by village council as punishment for 'unauthorised' relationship and failure to pay fine","newspaperPageNumber":"19","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6v5","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390499871277/Gang-rape-in-Birbhum-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390499871277/Gang-rape-in-Birbhum-006.jpg","wordcount":"924","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427872974","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8598626","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jason Burke in Kolkata","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031728","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T18:01:08Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/court-gang-rape-indian-village-birbhum","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/court-gang-rape-indian-village-birbhum","tags":[{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/india","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jasonburke","webTitle":"Jason Burke","rcsId":"GNL001549","r2ContributorId":"15798","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/2/1267538178716/Jason-Burke.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jason Burke is the south Asia correspondent of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers.</p><p>In more than a decade as a staff correspondent with the papers Burke has reported on a wide range of subjects in countries from Algeria to Cambodia, from Uzebkistan to Zimbabwe. </p><p>Based in Pakistan from 1998 to 2002,  reporting from Afghanistan under the Taliban and during the war of 2001, he has returned to both Pakistan and Afghanistan many times since.

foreign news sites that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/22/chinese-oil-giants-offshore-shell-companies-caribbean\">revealed details of offshore holdings by the relatives of senior leaders</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;continued in China as reports emerged&nbsp;of a propaganda directive ordering websites and services to target users posting on the subject.</p><p>Details of the order were published by China Digital Times, a website that monitors censorship instructions. </p><p>“Immediately find and remove the<a href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/01/leaked-records-reveal-offshore-holdings-chinas-elite/\"> foreign media report “China’s Secret Offshore Tax Havens”</a> and related content. Interactive platforms must strictly check [users]. Related images and accusatory comments about leaders and the system [of government] must be deleted without exception,” said the instructions, <a href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/01/minitrue-offshore-taxes-onshore-cyberattack/\">according to CDT</a>.</p><p>“Block the [user] IDs of those who have an evil influence and coordinate on-the-ground investigations with the relevant departments.”</p><p>Such directives are often delivered verbally and are extremely sensitive. The Guardian has not verified the order independently.</p><p>The website Greatfire.org, which monitors which overseas sites are censored by China, reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2014/jan/21/china-british-virgin-islands-wealth-offshore-havens\">the Guardian</a>, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)&nbsp;and six more sites that worked on the project <a href=\"https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2014/jan/massive-blocking-foreign-media-china\">were partly or completely blocked</a>.&nbsp;The sites&nbsp;began to experience access problems <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2014/jan/21/china-british-virgin-islands-wealth-offshore-havens\">around the time they published the reports</a>.</p><p>The New York Times and Bloomberg websites have been blocked in China since 2012, when they carried reports on the wealth of leaders’ families.</p><p>Reports of the directive emerged as ICIJ, which has co-ordinated the two-year investigation into offshore secrecy, <a href=\"http://offshoreleaks.icij.org/\">prepared to publish the details of more than 37,000 offshore companies</a>&nbsp;and trusts with ties to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.&nbsp;The details had previously been withheld from the ICIJ register, to allow reporters at organisations&nbsp;including the Guardian to research Chinese offshore ties. The database now discloses previously secret details of the owners of more than 100,000 offshore entities.</p><p> </p><p>The ICIJ said the publication of the details, which it hopes will inspire further investigations and research, was in the interests of bringing accountability to the notoriously impenetrable offshore world.</p><p> </p><p>“Secrecy creates an environment where fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and other forms of corruption thrive. The Offshore Leaks Database helps remove this secrecy,” said the&nbsp;ICIJ director, Gerard Ryle. “Opening up the records serves the public interest by bringing accountability to an industry that has long operated in the shadows.”</p><p>On Wednesday, a spokesman for Beijing’s foreign ministry suggested readers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/22/china-block-reports-offshire-elite-british-virgin-islands\">would suspect the intentions behind “unconvincing” reports on the offshore assets</a>.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/22/china-block-reports-offshire-elite-british-virgin-islands\">&nbsp;</a></p><p>Some guarded references to the story could still be seen on the Sina Weibo microblog on Thursday, but&nbsp;many more comments and links had been deleted and the Free Weibo site, <a href=\"https://freeweibo.com/en/\">which allows people to search censored posts</a>,&nbsp;said “ICIJ” had been blocked as a keyword.</p><p>Some users appeared to have deleted related posts themselves. Recent months have seen an intensification of China’s controls on the internet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/15/china-microblogging-accounts-closed\">including the targeting of opinion formers </a>and the announcement of a judicial interpretation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/china-social-media-jail-rumours\">allowing internet users to be tried for defamation</a> if untrue posts online are visited by 5,000 internet users or reposted more than 500 times.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/china-social-media-jail-rumours\">&nbsp;</a>The authorities have said the measure is necessary to prevent online rumours hurting individuals and damaging society.</p><p>Zhang Lifan, an independent scholar, told the&nbsp;Associated Press that the use of offshore holdings by those with ties to officials gave a strong impression of privilege and impunity.</p><p>Wen Yunchao, a well-known internet activist who now lives outside the mainland, said that while ordinary people might not fully understand the story, it was \"a major blow to the prestige of the authorities\", pointing to the contrast with Xi's recent visit to a budget restaurant&nbsp;where he mingled with ordinary citizens.</p><p>The use of offshore structures can facilitate the avoidance of tax or the&nbsp;moving of money overseas. However, offshore companies can also be an important tool for legitimate Chinese businesses, especially when operating overseas, due to restrictions and legislation in the country.</p><p><b><br><br></b></p>","headline":"China blocks foreign news sites that revealed elite's offshore holdings","trailText":"Guardian and International Consortium of Investigative Journalists

Officials fear the death toll will climb and said firefighters could not save people they saw and heard.</p><p>Acting mayor, Ginette Caron, said many of those unaccounted for were confined to wheelchairs and walkers, noting that only five residents in the centre were fully autonomous. She said some had Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>The massive fire in the 52-unit complex broke out around 12:30 am in L'Isle-Verte, a small town of 1,500 people about 140 miles (225km) north-east of Quebec City.</p><p>\"About 31 people are on the list of people that Quebec police are looking for. This is very bad news because they have challenges moving around,\" said Francois Lapointe, the member of parliament for the area.</p><p>\"We're down to hoping that some of those 31 people were not there … The volunteer firefighters did everything they could. They basically couldn't save some people they could hear or see,\" he said. Lapointe said one man could see his mother on a balcony but could not rescue her.</p><p>Pascal Fillion, who lives near the seniors' home, said he ran outside to find a group of locals and firefighters already at the scene, trying everything to save the panicked people inside.</p><p>For the most part, he said, rescuers felt helpless against a fast-moving blaze with smoke so thick it was nearly impossible to approach the building.</p><p>\"People tried to do whatever they could, but the fire was so intense that there wasn't much that could be done,\" he said. \"I saw people crying, I saw people collapse because they were watching those people burn.\"</p><p>The fire broke out in -4 Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) temperatures, causing equipment to freeze, L'Iles-Verte fire chief Yvan Charron said. </p><p>Another man, a stricken Jacques Berube, stood outside the residence as he pondered the fate of his missing 99-year-old mother, Adrienne Dube. Berube, 70, tried to locate her at a hospital in nearby Riviere-du-Loup as well as at a school in L'Isle-Verte, where residents were initially taken.</p><p>Berube was getting ready to hear the worst about his mother, who is blind but still mobile.</p><p>\"I went near the building; the corner where her room was is burned,\" he said. \"I'll just have to wait and see. I don't like it. But I don't have any choice. It's just reality.\"</p><p>Lapointe said it will take about two or three hours for officials to go through what is left of the gutted building.</p><p>Initial reports said 20 residents had been transported to safety, but it was unclear just how many residents were missing in the fire. Sgt Ann Mathieu of Quebec provincial police urged people who have any information on people considered missing to call police.</p><p>Mario Michaud, who lives across the street from the building, said he witnessed the unfolding drama shortly after midnight.</p><p>\"I got up to go to the toilet and I saw smoke,\" Michaud told local newspaper Info Dimanche.</p><p>\"The fire had started on the second floor. I woke up my girlfriend and called 911. I saw the firefighters and they got to work. A woman on the second floor was shouting and she went out on to the balcony. Her son went to get a ladder but he couldn't get to her. She burned to death.\"</p><p>At least three people were injured in the blaze. The extent of their injuries was unclear.</p><p>The building was home to more than 50 people and also housed a social agency, a pharmacy and a hair salon.</p><p>The centre, called the Residence du Havre, opened in 1997. A Quebec health department document updated last July said that the three-storey building, with one elevator, was constructed entirely of wood.</p><p>Most residents were older than 75 and 37 of them were older than 85. The building included both single rooms and apartment-style dwellings. The document also indicates that the building was only partially fitted with a sprinkler system but did have a fire alarm. There were smoke detectors in every room and in the building itself.</p><p>The same document indicates that two employees tend to work overnight during the week.</p><p>Several fire departments in the region were called in to help extinguish the blaze, which completely destroyed the building.</p><p>The fire comes just six months after 47 people were killed in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, when a train with 72 oil tankers derailed and exploded in the small community.</p><p>The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, made a statement offering his condolences on behalf of the entire country.</p><p>In 1969, a nursing-home fire in the community of Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Quebec, claimed 54 lives.</p>","headline":"Five dead, 30 missing in blaze at Quebec elderly home","trailText":"<p>Desperate search for trapped residents after fire rips through residence in early hours of Thursday morning </p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5m4","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390511141318/Firefighter-sprays-water--006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390511141318/Firefighter-sprays-water--006.jpg","wordcount":"759","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427859142","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8597852","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Associated Press in Quebec","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031592","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T15:45:21Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/deadly-blaze-quebec-elderly-home","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/deadly-blaze-quebec-elderly-home","tags":[{"id":"world/canada","webTitle":"Canada","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/canada","references":[]},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/americas","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427901932","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390511134588/Firefighter-sprays-water--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Mathieu Belanger","altText":"Firefighter sprays water at the Residence du Havre","height":"54","credit":"Mathieu Belanger/Reuters","caption":"A firefighter sprays water at the Residence du Havre after the blaze in L'Isle Verte, Quebec.

airport heist dramatised in the hit Martin Scorsese movie Goodfellas, an elderly reputed mobster was arrested at his New York City home on Thursday and charged over the robbery and a 1969 murder.</p><p>Vincent Asaro, 78, was named along with his son Jerome and three other defendants in a wide-ranging indictment alleging murder, robbery, extortion, arson and other crimes from the late 1960s up until last year.</p><p>The Asaros, both identified as captains in the Bonanno organised crime family, pleaded not guilty and were held without bail at a brief appearance in federal court in Brooklyn.</p><p>The elder Asaro's lawyer, Gerald McMahon, told reporters outside court that his client was framed by shady turncoat gangsters, including the former Bonanno boss Joseph Massino, the highest-ranking member of the city's five organised crime families to break the mob's vow of silence.</p><p>McMahon described Massino as one of the worst witnesses he had ever seen. He added that Asaro had given him \"marching orders\" that \"there will be no plea and he will walk out the door a free man\".</p><p>A lawyer for Jerome Asaro declined comment.</p><p>The indictment accused Asaro of helping to direct the Lufthansa Airlines heist at Kennedy airport on 11 December 1978, one of the largest cash thefts in American history.</p><p>The gunmen looted a vault in the airline's cargo terminal and stole about $5m in untraceable US currency that was being returned to the United States from Germany, along with about $1m worth of jewellery. The cash was never found.</p><p>According to court papers, an unidentified mob associate who pleaded guilty and became a co-operating witness told investigators that he participated in the robbery at the direction of Asaro. The theft was hatched by James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Burke, a late Lucchese crime family associate who was close to Asaro, who told the bandits that he had a \"score\" that would make them rich.</p><p>The papers say that each robber was supposed to be paid $750,000, but the co-operating witness said that most did not receive their share, either because they were killed first or it was never given to them.</p><p>The papers say the co-operator wore a wire and recorded a conversation he had with Asaro in 2011 in which the pair discussed being slighted.</p><p>\"We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get,\" Asaro said, according to the court papers. \"Jimmy Burke kept everything.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427932601'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/24/1390557457362/Alleged-mobster-Vincent-A-006.jpg' alt='Alleged mobster Vincent Asaro charged over 1978 airport heist' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Vincent Asaro is escorted by FBI agents. Photograph: Bryan Smith/Zuma Press/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the heist, the elder Asaro was charged over the 1969 murder of Paul Katz, whose remains were found last year during an FBI dig at a house once occupied by Burke. According to the co-operating witness, Asaro and Burke were business partners in Robert's Lounge. The saloon was described by a fellow Lucchese associate of Burke, the late Henry Hill, as Burke's private cemetery.</p><p>\"Jimmy buried over a dozen bodies … under the bocce courts,\" Hill wrote in his book A Goodfella's Guide to New York.</p><p>Katz once owned a warehouse where mobsters stored stolen goods, according to the court papers. After a raid at the warehouse, Asaro and Burke began to suspect Katz was a law enforcement informant.</p><p>Asaro told the co-operator that Burke \"had killed Katz with a dog chain because they believed he was a 'rat',\" the papers say. In the 1980s, Burke ordered the co-operator to dig up the remains and move them to another location.</p><p>The co-operator told investigators that Asaro and Burke had brought Katz's body to a vacant home in Queens where it was concealed beneath a cement floor.</p><p>Burke was the inspiration for Robert De Niro's character in Goodfellas, which was based on Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy and told the story of Hill's time in the mob and subsequent co-operation with law enforcement.</p><p>Massino was convicted in 2004 on charges that he had a hand in multiple gangland murders, including the execution of a mobster who vouched for the FBI undercover agent Donnie Brasco – a story that was also turned into a movie.</p><p>In July, Massino saw his life prison sentence reduced to time served, after prosecutors praised his work as a government co-operator.</p>","headline":"Alleged mobster Vincent Asaro charged over 1978 'Goodfellas' airport heist","trailText":"Asaro, 78, is accused of

Calling for relations with Europe to be \"normalised\", he said Iran could become a \"top 10\" economy.</p><p>Sanctions – such as those that have cut $1bn a day off its oil production since 2012 – serve to \"exacerbate divergence\", Rouhani said.</p><p>\"I view Iran's economy as the most congruent, capable and most closest to successful emerging economies and I envisage Iran's place alongside them in the future,\" Rouhani said.</p><p>He talked of \"constructive engagement\" with the world and \"active foreign policy\" to achieve his economic goals. When asked by Klaus Schwab, the head of the WEF, if this meant good relations with all countries, Rouhani said that it was with countries \"we officially recognise\".</p><p>Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, later dismissed Rouhani's speech, telling the WEF that these were a \"change in words and unchanging deeds\".</p><p>Arab countries, Netanyahu said, \"understand that Iran remains aggressive, supports terror, that it participates in the slaughter in Syria, [and] that is pursuing the development of ballistic missile and plutonium for nuclear weapons\".</p><p>Netanyahu is in Davos with the Israeli president Shimon Perez to encourage investment into the country's technology hubs.</p><p>Rouhani stressed he had been democratically elected last year and referred to the uprisings in the Middle East, saying that culture and spirituality were also needed. \"Economic factors alone are not enough to provide a better world for people,\" he said.</p><p>He said it was \"possible to replace suicidal hopelessness with hope in the future\", and added: \"The security of world is intertwined with the security of the Middle East.\"</p><p>He revealed he had met leaders of leading oil firms on Thursday morning in Davos – thought to be Eni, BP, Total and Shell – to discuss energy security.</p>","headline":"Davos 2014: Iran ready to engage with the world, says Rouhani","trailText":"President signals he wants end to Iran's isolation and says it has no plans to use nuclear technology as weapons","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5ex","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390477728393/Hassan-Rouhani-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390477728393/Hassan-Rouhani-006.jpg","wordcount":"442","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427831133","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8595747","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jill Treanor and Larry Elliott in Davos","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031373","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T11:52:21Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/davos-iran-ready-engage-world-rouhani","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/davos-iran-ready-engage-world-rouhani","tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/iran","references":[]},{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/hassan-rouhani","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos","webTitle":"Davos","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos-2014","webTitle":"Davos 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos-2014","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jilltreanor","webTitle":"Jill Treanor","rcsId":"GNL003510","r2ContributorId":"15822","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jill_treanor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jill Treanor is the Guardian's City editor.

The personal information of 70 million customers was also compromised.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Luxury retail chain Neiman Marcus has said it too was the victim of a cyber-attack, and sources have told Reuters that other retail chains have also been breached. Neiman Marcus said about 1.1m&nbsp;customer cards were exposed by a data breach from 16&nbsp;July&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;October&nbsp;last year.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In all these attacks, cyber criminals used memory-parsing software, also known as a \"RAM scraper\". When a customer swipes a credit or debit card, the POS terminal grabs the transaction data from the magnetic stripe and transfers it to the retailer's payment processing provider. While the data is encrypted during the process, RAM scrapers extract the information while it is in the computer's live memory, where it very briefly appears in plain text.&nbsp;</p><p>RAM scraping technology has been around for a long time, but its use has increased in recent years. Developers of the malware have also enhanced its features to make it more difficult to be detected by anti-virus software deployed on POS systems running Windows software.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;said in its report that one variant of the malicious POS software, known as Alina, included an option that allowed remote upgrades, making it tougher for corporate security teams to identify and eradicate it. The report said at least one type of malware has been offered for sale for as much as $6,000 in a \"well-known\" underground forum.&nbsp;<br></p><p>\"The high dollar value gained from some of these compromises can encourage intruders to develop high sophistication methodologies, as well as incorporate mechanisms for the actors to remain undetected,\" the report said.&nbsp;</p><p>A spokesman for the Washington-based National Retail Federation, a trade group, said he had no immediate comment.&nbsp;</p><p>One cyber-security consultant who has reviewed the&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;report, said the findings were troubling for the retail industry.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Everybody we work with in the retail space is scared to death because they don't have a lot of defenses to prepare against these types of attacks,\" said the consultant, who is advising several retailers in current investigations.&nbsp;</p><p>\"This is not just based on anybody saying 'This is going to happen.' This is based on statistical data that the&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;is seeing,\" said the consultant, who was not authorized to publicly comment on the details of the report.&nbsp;</p><p>Retailers need to move quickly to get better tools in their networks that can analyze traffic patterns on the fly and identify any unusual activity, said another expert in retail security, who has audited POS systems to find vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.&nbsp;</p><p>The expert said it was more difficult for small-to-mid sized retailers to do this because they did not have as much money and expertise as major retailers.</p><p>The&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;report said the bulk of the POS malware cases that the agency has investigated involve small-to-mid sized local or regional businesses, whose estimated losses each range from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>The US&nbsp;secret service usually takes the lead in credit card breach investigations for the federal government, though the&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;sometimes opens its own cases or asked to assist. The secret service is leading the investigations into the breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus.&nbsp;</p><p>A spokesman for the secret service declined to comment on the&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;report to retailers.&nbsp;<br></p>","headline":"FBI warns retailers to prepare for more cyber-attacks in wake of Target breach","trailText":"Three-page report describes risks of credit card-targeting malware as

is&nbsp;unconstitutional<br>•&nbsp;Move follows court rulings&nbsp;in Utah and Oklahoma</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-23T18:24:40.674Z","body":"<p>The attorney general of Virginia has announced that the state will no longer defend its constitutional ban on gay marriage, siding instead with same-sex couples who are suing to have it struck down.<br></p><p>Mark Herring said on Thursday that he wanted to ensure the state was “on the right side of history, and the right side of the law”.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Lawyers and marriage equality campaigners hailed the decision as “courageous” in a state with a socially conservative tradition. Herring defeated his Republican opponent by only 165 votes in last November’s elections, when voters also chose a Democrat, Terry McAuliffe, as governor.<br></p><p>Gay marriage bans are being challenged by lawsuits in many other conservative states. In the past two months, federal judges have struck down gay marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Appeals are pending, and the latest decision adds to the likelihood that the issue will return to the US supreme court sooner rather than later.<br></p><p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/23/265050444/virginias-new-attorney-general-will-not-defend-gay-marriage-ban\">In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with National Public Radio</a>, which first reported Herring’s decision, he said: “As attorney general, I cannot and will not defend laws that violate Virginians' rights. The commonwealth will be siding with the plaintiffs in this case and with every other Virginia couple whose right to marry is being denied.”<br></p><p>Herring's spokesman, Michael Kelly, said he would be filing a brief with the federal court on Thursday morning notifying them of a change in the state's position. The plaintiffs in the lawsuits are two couples: Timothy Bostic and Tony London, and Carol Schall and Mary Townley. Bostic and London applied for a marriage license at Norfolk's circuit court clerk's office in July 2013 but were turned down.</p><p>Theodore Olson, the lead co-counsel for two of the Virginia plaintiffs, described it as a “ great day” for Virginia and said he looked forward to working with Herring to strike down the state's “odious marriage ban”.</p><p>Olson,&nbsp;who together with David Boies secured a historic victory in the supreme court in June last year which restored marriage equality in California, said: “Virginia’s marriage laws are needlessly mean-spirited and cause harsh and gratuitous pain and humiliation to gay and lesbian Virginians and their families.<br></p><p>“Attorney General Herring’s actions today have brought Virginia that much closer to the quintessential American ideals of equality under the law and the freedom to pursue happiness.”<br></p><p>Adam Umhoefer, the director of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, sponsor of the challenges to the California and Virginia same-sex marriage bans, said he hoped others would follow Herring's lead. “The majority of Americans and the majority of Virginians agree that loving, committed couples like our plaintiffs Mary and Carol, and Tim and Tony, deserve the dignity and respect that comes with marriage.”<br></p><p>The election of Herring as attorney general and McAuliffe as governor marked a new chapter for the state. The Republican former attorney general Ken Cuccinelli was a social conservative who sought to maintain the ban on same-sex marriage. Since his appointment, McAuliffe has issued an executive order on inauguration day prohibiting discrimination against state employees who are gay.<br></p><p>In 2006, 57% of Virginians voted to approve the same-sex marriage ban. But recent polling has shown a small majority in favour of marriage equality. A Quinnipiac University poll in July found 50%&nbsp;of registered&nbsp;Virginia&nbsp;voters supported same-sex marriage, while 43% opposed it.<br></p><p>Marriage equality advocates say the issue has a particular resonance in&nbsp;Virginia&nbsp;because of a landmark 1967 US&nbsp;supreme court decision that struck down its ban on&nbsp; interracial marriage.<br></p><p>Mildred and Richard Loving had been married in Washington DC&nbsp;and were living in&nbsp;Virginia&nbsp;when police raided their home in 1958 and charged them with violating the state's \"racial integrity\" law. They were convicted, but won at the supreme court.<br></p><p>Herring referred to the case in his NPR interview: \"There have been times in some key landmark cases where Virginia was on the wrong side, was on the wrong side of history and on the wrong side of the law,\" he said. \"And as attorney general, I'm going to make sure that the [people] presenting the state's legal position on behalf of the people of Virginia are on the right side of history and on the right side of the law.\"<br></p><p>Herring acknowledged he had changed his position on the issue and said he had always spoken out against discrimination: \"I was wrong for not applying it to marriage,\" he said, acknowledging that his children had played a part in changing his mind.<br></p><p>There are 29 states with constitutional bans on same-sex marriage, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Most have Republican attorney generals. Sarah Warbelow, the state legislative director of the Human Rights Campaign, said Herring’s decision could influence others. “It is certainly possible that attorneys general from other states will look at this decision and it may inform their decisions moving forward. The majority of states that have constitutional bans on same-sex marriage have Republican attorneys general, who are under pressure from the party to defend the constitutional amendments.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“However, if members of the bar like attorneys general are constantly saying these amendments are unconstitutional, that will have an impact on judges.”<br></p>","headline":"Virginia attorney general switches sides on state's gay marriage ban","trailText":"Mark&nbsp;Herring says same-sex&nbsp;marriage prohibition is&nbsp;unconstitutional","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5tq","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390484944764/afb07d79-9c95-44c3-84c1-6b71fd41d40f-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390484944764/afb07d79-9c95-44c3-84c1-6b71fd41d40f-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427846605","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e11b84e4b065f7ddbb83ac","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Karen McVeigh in New York","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031506","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T14:01:39Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/virginia-attorney-general-gay-marriage-ban-mark-herring","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/23/virginia-attorney-general-gay-marriage-ban-mark-herring","tags":[{"id":"world/gay-rights","webTitle":"Gay rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gay-rights","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/gay-rights","references":[]},{"id":"world/virginia","webTitle":"Virginia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/virginia","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/sexuality","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/sexuality","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/karenmcveigh","webTitle":"Karen McVeigh","r2ContributorId":"19143","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/karen_mcveigh_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Karen McVeigh has been a senior news reporter for the Guardian since December 2006.

Both maintain their innocence.</p><p>Zhao's hearing ended shortly after it began when he sacked his lawyers to delay proceedings, the lawyer, Zhang Xuezhong, said in a phone interview. \"The court barred most of our evidence, especially our video evidence,\" Zhang said. \"This is completely against the law.\"</p><p>Hou's trial took place on Thursday afternoon; she pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Chinese authorities will try <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/22/xu-zhiyong-trial-china-official-reaction-new-citizens-movement\" title=\"\">at least eight anti-corruption activists</a> this week and on Monday, in a culmination of a protracted crackdown against the group, which began last summer after Xu Zhiyong, founder of the New Citizens Movement, organised small protests demanding that government officials declared their assets. Nearly 20 members have been detained.</p><p>While the group's aims of promoting transparency and equality seemingly dovetail with official priorities – Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, has sought to portray himself as a hard anti-corruption campaigner – the crackdown belies his administration's unyielding line on dissent.</p><p>China's Communist party controls the nation's courts, and despite oft-repeated promises of judicial independence the outcome of politically sensitive cases is almost always predetermined.</p><p>Xu and Zhao claimed the authorities had barred them from presenting evidence and obstructed most of their witnesses from testifying.</p><p>Zhao was allowed 15 days to find a new defence team, Zhang said. The  trial is likely to  reopen mid  February, after China's week-long Lunar New Year holiday.</p><p>Zhang welcomed the delay, saying a later trial may draw more domestic and international attention as it would not be eclipsed by the flurry of other hearings.</p><p>The US and other western countries have expressed concern at the ongoing prosecution of nonviolent protesters. A group of western diplomats was barred from attending the trials of both Zhao and Xu.</p><p>\"The US government calls on Chinese authorities to release Xu and other political prisoners immediately,\" said Gary Locke, the American ambassador to China.</p><p>Zhao was formerly a history teacher, working in the north-west province of Shaanxi. He has already received two prison sentences for his activism since the late 1980s, both for circulating pro-democracy petitions.</p><p>On Wednesday 78 prominent Chinese intellectuals <a href=\"http://chinachange.org/2014/01/22/open-recommendation-to-conduct-constitutional-review-on-the-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-on-assemblies-processions-and-demonstrations/\" title=\"\">released an open letter</a> to the National People's Congress, China's legislature, demanding that the government adhered to its own constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and assembly.</p><p></p><p>\"Systematically safeguarding citizens' rights to assemble, proceed and demonstrate can avoid violent, sudden disruption, of social order,\" it said. \"A society without a safety valve like this is a dangerous society where conflict builds up, resentment seeps deeper, and revolt grow stronger.\"</p><p>One of the movement's most high-profile supporters, Wang Gongquan, a 52-year-old venture capitalist, was freed on bail on Wednesday after spending four months in detention.</p><p>The Beijing No 1 intermediate people's court said he had repented for helping to \"organise and incite criminal activities\".</p><p>Xu maintained a defiant stance during his closing argument at his trial on Wednesday morning, his lawyer Zhang Qingfang said in a phone interview.
