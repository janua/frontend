(They’re getting some really good business out of me at the moment.) I picked up a croissant, a cup of coffee, a sandwich and a banana. The banana didn’t actually cause any waste problems, mostly because I gave it to Bibi in exchange for an apple, but I’m sure the banana skin went into the food waste bin, like my apple core. The paper part of the coffee cup I washed out and recycled, but I’m left wondering about the lid. Can I take these to Lush? I’m also left with the polythene wrapper from my sandwich and a strange plastic sheet that came around my croissant. Not a good day. Although I did use up some cheese, half an onion and a couple of eggs to make an omelette for dinner.

Not even a jibe from our Production Editor about \"going off to the allotment\" could put a dent in my pride.

I keep them right by the kitchen door, and on a sunny day the smell drifts in and distracts me from whatever I'm supposed to be doing. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53733ce9e4b0877105b6e6bb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-14T11:52:57.621+01:00\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Katherine's Waste Diary - Day 1</b></p><p>Most mornings I grab a coffee from the canteen after I arrive at the office and by the end of the week my desk has a fair few coffee cups – paper ones with a plastic lid - dotted around it. I always wash these out and pop them in the recycling bin, even though I never really checked to see if the plastic lid was recyclable. After a quick internet search it turns out that the lids are made from polystyrene, which is \"not generally recycled in the UK\". Drat - that's a lot of recycling bags I've contaminated, and now I have a coffee lid as the first item in my very own \"pile of shame\". <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GdnLiveBetter/statuses/466526763896807425\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>We&#39;ve been trying to achieve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23zerowaste&amp;src=hash\">#zerowaste</a> in the office.

Thursday, however, was not one of those days and I popped to the Pret-a-Manger down the road for a sandwich. Thankfully, my sandwich packaging was 100% recyclable (thanks, Pret!) but my empty crisp packet gives no indication of which bin I can put it in. I tweeted Pret to ask them if their crisp packets are recyclable, but received no reply. </p><p>I am proud to say that my banana skin went straight into the food waste bin. I've always assumed this goes to compost, but I emailed our building management just to make sure and they assured me that not only was all the food waste composted but that \"during the process the methane the waste produces is also recycled into a natural fuel source\".

Which was great in many ways – you learn how to audit absolutely everything – but was also really really tedious. There were a couple of guys from the London Fire Brigade along too and we all sat together in the back row, cracking jokes, that sort of thing. And it turned that they’d come along because they were trying to solve a few environmental problems. And one of them was that they had all these firehoses they were having to put into landfill and they just couldn’t find any other use for it. </p><p>Basically if there’s a hole in firehose which can’t be fixed then you can’t just cut it in half and use it anyway. A firehose has to be long so that you can reach the fire. And part of the hose was also just coming to the end of its 30-year lifespan. I went to visit them at work, and they had tonnes and tonnes of this beautiful, heroic material that was just going into landfill. I made a promise to them right then, that I’d come up with a way to use it and I’d give half the profits back to them. They’ve told me since they thought at the time that it was all hysterically funny and never really expected to hear from me again. But actually it’s ended being their longest-running, most successful recycling partnership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://vimeo.com/64940759\"data-alt=\"Live Better: Elvis and Kresse\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/64940759&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/64940759&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When we actually started making the bags, we hit snag after snag. We couldn’t find a sewing machine that was strong enough, to begin with; we killed four before we managed to find one that could cope. Then we got in touch with all the craft leather workshops in the UK, but they all turned us down, so in the end Elvis had to teach himself to sew to begin with. </p><p>Then we had no cash. So we made four prototypes and then I went round London, showing them to people, and asking them to buy off-plan, like an apartment. And about 200 people trusted us and went for it, and then we were off. The first two years were hard, very hard, but after a couple of years word started to get around. Since then it has been amazing; we now sell all over the world. Cameron Diaz wore one of our belts in Vogue, that was wonderful. And we did a collaboration recently with Bill Amberg which was just great; when we met up with him we spent the first three hours talking about water mills and self-sufficiency before we got down to the actual bag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9ffdbf9e-b702-4ad5-a186-b97b1f15b15f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/15/1400159347703/d2d747b3-ae9e-4963-85c8-6a2b69b35bfa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Live Better: Satchel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Elvis &amp; Kresse make items from genuine decommissioned fire-hoses.

It’s the patches, the leftovers, the little scraps left over by our leatherworkers. And it’s such a beautiful material, it’s got such a wonderful smell. You can’t compost it, it would be terrible to incinerate it. There’s a German process for recycling it but it involves shredding it and turning it into something else and that just seems such a shame. </p><p>We’ve come up with a kind of jigsaw solution, a way of weaving a multitude of pieces together in an entirely organic form that can be used as a rug, or to cover your sofa, or for your walls. And we’re just rolling that out now. </p><p>I’m now entrepreneur in residence at the Said School in Oxford, and one of the students asked me the other day if I feel as if I can relax now. No! I feel as if we’re only just getting started. At the moment we’re only diverting a tiny fraction of the UK’s waste stream from landfill, and I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways of diverting more. We need, we urgently need to change people, to change the way people value our environment.</p><p><i>As told to Bibi van der Zee.</i></p><p><i>Kresse Wesling and her partner James Henrit<i> are the team behind Elvis &amp; Kresse</i>.

We see those three arrows chasing each other and we like to believe that our garbage is part of a virtuous circle of production where a milk jug comes back as a milk jug. After all, the prefix “re” means “again” and implies that it is being used for the same purpose.</p><p>In fact most of the time it is being what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_to_Cradle:_Remaking_the_Way_We_Make_Things\">architect Bill McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart call “downcycled”</a>, turned into a product of lower value. Recycling is not a virtuous circle; it’s a downward spiral. It should really be considered a poor third choice after reducing and reusing. There is also a fourth option that is seriously gaining ground, and that’s repurposing.</p><p>In 1968, the critic and landscape architect Charles Jencks wrote about repurposing design. He called it “adhocism” and described it in his book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780262518444\">Adhocism: The Case for Improvisation</a>. </p><p>“Basically it involves using an available system or dealing with an existing situation in a new way to solve a problem quickly and effectively. It is a method of creation relying particularly on resources which are already at hand.”</p><p>It was a very big deal in the counterculture, as writer <a href=\"http://alastairgordonwalltowall.com/books-by-alastair-gordon/\">Alastair Gordon describes in his book Spaced Out</a>:</p><p> “There was scrounging and recycling of old materials, living off the spoils of straight society. “Trapped inside a waste economy, man finds an identity as a consumer … Once outside the trap, he finds enormous resources at his disposal – free.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e9d1fb18-2d1e-4df1-9a81-8308af8543c7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/14/1400083741525/13ec545f-3386-46ed-b686-a7923a1a757e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Desk by Brothers Dressler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A desk by Brothers Dressler from Canada made out of cast-iron radiators. Photograph: Brothers Dressler</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alas, the design of many of these upcycled items retained a hippie vibe well into the current century. However the last few years have seen talented designers take an interest in working with found, repurposed materials. It is often clever, whimsical, cheap and cheerful and it is the best kind of recycling, adding significant value. They are taking our detritus and “upcycling” it into something better, something useful, giving a second life to what otherwise would be landfill.</p><p>In Britain, <a href=\"http://www.stuarthaygarth.com/\">Stuart Haygarth</a> builds giant light fixtures out of discarded water bottles collected at Stansted Airport; he focuses on “the overlooked sculptural beauty of these plastic water containers.”</p><p>In the Netherlands, <a href=\"http://www.pietheineek.nl/en\">Piet Hein Eek</a> builds cabinets and kitchens out of discarded windows, chairs out of waste wood, seating out of old pipes and beams. It is often rough and appears unfinished. He writes: “I wanted to show that products that aren’t perfect still can appeal to our sense of aesthetic and functionality. I also wanted to design a product that could be made with limited means, material that was abundant.” </p><p>In France, <a href=\"http://coudamyarchitectures.com/design/f-light/\">Paul Coudamy</a> turns the inner walls and windows of old Airbus 300 jets into giant light fixtures. “These marvels of engineering with their ultra functional curves resulting from uncompromising technical research, are diverted from their original function in order to be integrated in our daily lives, thus offering them a second life.”</p><p>In Canada, Castor takes old burned out incandescent and fluorescent bulbs and buries new, energy-efficient light sources deep within, giving new light from old bulbs. The Brothers Dressler are making furniture out of cast-iron radiators.</p><p>In Germany, Design Direct combines old drawers into new frames to build marvellous collages that have a shape all their own. “The design is actually an anti design, where the shape resulting from the compilation of existing finds. The beauty is then less often in the form, as for example in the character and appearance of the individual drawers and their interplay.” <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-78172f9f-4338-41ca-bcc0-35305f00b180\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/14/1400083496334/4835c1a2-442f-4494-ab43-7668114b2279-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Design Direct combines old drawers into new frames to build marvellous collages\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Design Direct in Germany combines old drawers into new frames to build marvellous collages.

One of the problems of having millions of industrial shipping pallets made every year is that there are almost as many clunky, rough and uncomfortable pallet furniture designs that are guaranteed to give you splinters or poison you from either the insecticides they are treated with or the food contamination that is soaked into them. And except for the hilarious allusions to mid-century modern classics from the <a href=\"http://www.skatestudyhouse.com/html/home.html\">Skate Study House</a>, Sk8r bois should stay out of the furniture business.</p><p>One has to ask if this is making a difference, even the tiniest dent in the amount of waste we create. Of course the answer is no. Haygarth might use parts of a couple of hundred water bottles in his drop lamp; Britons throw out 10bn of them in a year. However, it might inspire us to think differently about what we do with our waste. More of us might agree with futurist Alex Steffen, who says: “There’s no such thing as garbage, just useful stuff on the wrong place.” Adhocism lives!</p><p><i>Lloyd Alter is managing editor at <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/\">Treehugger</a> and tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lloydalter\">@lloydalter</a>. <br></i></p><p><i>Feeling inspired? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/15/show-us-your-best-upcycled-efforts-and-win-a-camera?view=desktop\">Show us your best upcycled creations</a> for the change to win a Panasonic Lumix TZ40 camera. <br></i></p><p><em>Interested in finding out more about how you can </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live-better\"><em>live better</em></a><em>?

I’ve decided any gadget that uses it is either a marvel or a prototype. </p><p>The problem with solar energy is we’re not great at harnessing it yet. But it’s clearly a brilliant solution to our energy problems – just as we look back at the polluting, billowing smog of the <a>industrial revolution</a>, booing and hissing  in pantomime fashion at how damaging it was, I like to think we’ll look back at mining and fracking for energy as the bone-idle sun beats down on our backs and say: “Look! It’s behind you!”</p><p>Not that I’m hurrying the solar-energy scientists. They’re on it. The goal is in sight. And since the mainstream is still waiting for fully solar-powered flatscreens, cars and houses, we’re starting small with gadgets like solar-powered phone chargers and, in this week’s column, a radio and mp3 player.</p><h2>So how does it work? </h2><p>The Solar Condor DAB and FM radio is a pocket-sized portable radio, a bit smaller than a box of cigarettes, with a slot for a TF card (a micro SD card). A TF card loaded with songs means at the click of a button, you can turn the radio into an MP3 player. It comes with a pouch which doubles up as a set of two 2W speakers, with a solar panel on the front and a tiny blue light to indicate when it’s charging.</p><p><b>Online reviewers</b> were two and far between, and one was in Dutch.</p><p>The Dutch reviewer gave it four stars and, if two online translators are anything to go by, he thought the quality of the FM was better than the quality of the DAB, he called it a “fun device” and ended his review with some version of “fun times ahead”.</p><p>The English-speaking reviewer was a bit stingier. He only gave it three stars, but gave a thorough account of why:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>“It feels cheap and plasticy. The sound from the MP3 is good enough for listening to when you’re travelling. The FM radio works OK, and the DAB radio works pretty well too. Both rely on the headphones to be plugged in to act as the aerial. The biggest issue I have is with the MP3 controls. They are basically pitiful. When you turn the MP3 on it will always start navigation at the root folder stored on the memory card, so if you have your music stored by artist, then albums within each artists folder, prepare to spend a lot of time thumbing through the folders to get to the album you want to play.”</p></blockquote><h2>My own verdict: the minus points</h2><p>• The micro SD/TF card itself is not included. I don’t know about you, but I get so annoyed when I have to make multiple purchases for one item, you’d think I’d been told to hitchhike to the Amazon warehouse to pick them up. But, irrational pet peeves aside, you’d be hard-pressed to find a TF card for over a fiver, so for a £69.95 product, surely they could chuck one in for free?</p><p>• The MP3 controls were, as our online reviewer pointed out, a bit irritating – unlike the slick modern devices so many of us are spoiled by, there’s no quick scroll or search function, and thumbing through albums in order to find the one I wanted to hear is something I haven’t had to do for a while. </p><p>• The shuffle function on the Condor is such that you can only shuffle songs from any one album. Telling your MP3 player “surprise me” doesn’t work when every song is from the same Tom Waits album. Eventually I gave up and submitted to listening to the tracks in order as the artists intended. </p><p>• It comes with headphones that are mightily uncomfortable. They’re clearly made by someone who believes earholes to be perfectly round, so they either fall out or have to be shoved, somewhat painfully, right in. They’re made of the kind of plastic that makes your ears sweat, and there’s a tiny rattling sound when they shake. What I’m describing here is the experience of using cheap headphones after years of coddling my ears to the extent of £25 a pop. If your earholes are tougher than mine – or perfectly round – you might have a better time. </p><h2>And the plus points:</h2><p>• You don’t have to put the Condor on the windowsill or angle it directly towards the sun; as long as there’s light in the room, the little blue LED is blue, bright and eager, like the eyes of a Disney-animated bunny. </p><p>• I’m not going to claim that the energy used up charging portable radio MP3 players is as big a drain on our collective resources as, say, phone charging or heating homes. But every time we use solar power over the kind of energy we pay to use, we’re chipping away at the current, environmentally expensive norm. Today, solar-powered radios, tomorrow, solar powered computers, TVs, cars, houses! </p><p>• It’s versatile: you can charge it by solar power or USB.</p><p>• Once fully charged, it works for hours. I left it playing all evening and night before the battery ran down.</p><p>• It has a recording facility to record all the radio shows you’re missing while you fritter away your time working and sleeping (radio is brilliant, isn’t it? It’s like a podcast, but live! The wonders of old technology).</p><p>• It’s portable, and not just because it’s light enough to carry around. There’s a nifty metal hook on the pouch so it can be attached to a backpack and charge in the sun as you walk around. (The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp7A1-BKWhI\">product video</a> suggests you attach it to your “pants” – by which I assume it means trousers – but I imagine that would get annoying very fast.)</p><p>• At full volume, it’s loud. I couldn’t have it on full volume in my tiny flat as then I would be no better than my decibel-enthusiast neighbours. If I wanted to get back at them – or have music at a picnic – this would be ideal.</p><h2>In summation:</h2><p>It may not be as swish as some of the other gadgets in our lives, that can make calls and send emails and play movies and call in an air strike, but for a radio it does its job and doesn’t use electricity. And in an attempt to marry old and new technologies,  I’m going to refer to it as “the wireless”.<br></p><p>The Solar Condor DAB and FM radio can be bought from <a href=\"http://www.nigelsecostore.com/cgi-bin/sh000001.pl?REFPAGE=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nigelsecostore.com%2f&amp;WD=mp3%20solar%20dab%20radio&amp;SHOP=%20&amp;PN=Solar-MP3-and-DAB-radio.html%23aTA_2dPP_2dSolarcondor#aTA_2dPP_2dSolarcondor\"><i>Nigel’s Eco Store</i></a><i> for £69.95</i></p><p><em>Interested in finding out more about how you can </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live-better\"><em>live better</em></a><em>?

Celery and stilton soup</b></h2><p>If I ever needed a reason to be thankful, it is to the happy accident that led to the discovery of blue cheese. A combination of conditions – bacteria and man's willingness not to be put off by a bit of mould – means that we now have a whole glorious array of piquant blue cheeses that taste fabulous and cook beautifully. It is yet again another example of serendipity in the world of food. The fact that it goes so beautifully with <a href=\"http://www.lovecelery.co.uk/healthy_info/#.U16tY1V7BH4\">my favourite celery</a> means happy days.</p><p>In season, I like to use Fenland celery, a pale variety that was once a Victorian winter favourite, which is available from October to December, and has a mild, sweet and nutty flavour. Otherwise any celery will do, although often in winter I will substitute celeriac, a root vegetable, which to the uninitiated looks like something you would see on an episode of Dr Who; it has a somewhat monstrous and alien appearance, a bit like Captain Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean. But don't be put off by its tentacle-like roots. Celeriac has both an intensely celery flavour, with a hint of smokiness and goes beautifully with any tangy blue cheese.</p><p>Serves 4<br></p><p><b>Ingredients</b>:<br>50g butter<br>1 English onion, finely chopped<br>1-2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br>1 head of celery (including the leaves) or a medium celeriac (about 750g to 1kg), peeled and roughly chopped<br>1 carrot, roughly chopped<br>1 litre stock (vegetable or chicken)<br>100ml white wine (optional)<br>1 bay leaf<br>a sprig of fresh thyme (or half tsp dried thyme)<br>250ml milk<br>200g stilton or other blue cheese, crumbled (set a little aside to garnish the soup)<br>salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p>Melt the butter in a heavy-based saucepan and add the onion. Cook over a gentle heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, celery (or celeriac) and carrots. Stir and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the stock and white wine and bring to the boil.<br>Reduce to a simmer and add the bay leaf and thyme. Cover with a lid and simmer for 25 minutes.<br></p><p>Set aside and leave to cool before blending. Do not try to blend when hot, as this can be dangerous, particularly if using a jug blender. A combination of hot soup, a build-up of steam and vibration, can cause the hot liquid to explode out of the blender. Safer to let it cool a little!</p><p>Before blending remove the bay leaf and if using a sprig of thyme the woody stem. After blending, you may decide to pass the soup through a sieve for extra smoothness. Return the soup to a clean saucepan and bring back to a simmer. Add the milk and warm through.<br></p><p>Add the crumbled stilton and stir continuously until the cheese has melted into the soup. Do not let the soup boil as it may curdle.<br>Check the seasoning. It is unlikely you will need any salt as the cheese will be quite salty.<br></p><p>Serve with a little of the stilton crumbled over each bowl.<br></p><p><b>Tip</b>: For a thicker soup, add a couple of boiled potatoes when you add the celery.<br></p><h2>2. Roasted apple, cheese and shallot pithivier</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7f909a2f-d79a-491d-adec-fe23f5c3b43d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/13/1399982986158/8bd0755c-704f-47e8-960a-c165cfefffd6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roasted apple cheese and shallot pithivier\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Roasted apple cheese and shallot pithivier Photograph: /Rachel Kelly</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I love making pithiver (a French puff pastry pie) made by baking two circles of pastry with a delicious filling that oozed melting cheese). It is very simple, particularly if you use ready-made puff pastry. It has a bit of the wow factor, if I say so myself. It tastes even better.</p><p>Serves 4<br></p><p><b>Ingredients</b>:<br>olive oil<br>500g eating apples, cored, quartered and sliced about 5mm<br>300g shallots, peeled and sliced, about 5mm thick<br>fresh thyme sprigs<br>100g blue cheese (or cheddar), crumbled<br>salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>5 thyme branches<br>plain flour (for rolling out the pastry)<br>500g ready-made, butter puff pastry<br>1 egg, beaten<br>Pre-heat the oven to 200C/Gas Mark 6.</p><p>Combine the apples and shallots with roughly 50ml of olive oil. Add half a teaspoon of salt, a generous grinding of black pepper and the thyme sprigs. Tip into a roasting dish and spread out the mixture. Roast for about 20 to 30 minutes, turning the mixture occasionally. The mixture should be a light golden brown and tender. Set aside to cool.<br></p><p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 5 or 6mm thick. You will need to cut out two circles, one bigger than the other. I used plates to cut around. The pastry base had a diameter of 25cm and the pastry top was 29cm. You need to make sure that there is at least a 3cm difference as the larger piece will be going over the smaller one and the topping.</p><p>Lay the smaller pastry circle on a lined baking tray and prick several times with a fork.<br></p><p>Lay out some of the apple and onion mixture over the smaller circle. Make sure that you don't go all the way to the edge; leave a margin of at least 2cm (as this will form your pie edge). Add a little of the crumbled cheese. Season with black pepper.<br></p><p>Repeat the layers. Depending on how big your pastry base is, you may only get two complete layers in or perhaps three.<br></p><p>Brush the pastry margin with a little of the beaten egg.<br></p><p>Lay the larger pastry circle over the top (trying to keep it centred!)<br></p><p>Press down on the edges with your fingers to seal the filling in.<br></p><p>I knocked up the edges and then decorated the top by using a very sharp knife to make half-moon shapes spiraling from the centre. I also cut out a tiny circle in the top, to allow steam to escape, but gently rested the pastry circle on its hole (as the pastry will expand when cooking).<br></p><p>Brush with the beaten egg and set aside in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking.<br></p><p>Pre-heat the oven to 180C/Gas Mark 5.<br></p><p>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown. Careful before serving, it will be hot!<br></p><p><b>Tips</b>: Works beautifully with other cheeses such as cheddar, Lancashire or a hard goat or sheep milk cheese. My mother used to make individual sized pithivers with Jerusalem artichokes, mushrooms and goats' cheese to serve to any vegetarians she might have been feeding. The vegetarians usually ended up having to fend off the meat-eaters as these little pies were gorgeous. This recipe is also wonderful with pears and with celeriac.<br></p><h2>3. Blue cheese and honey tartine</h2><p>A tartine is a French open-face sandwich, often made with sourdough bread; just a slice of bread or toast with delicious toppings, very similar to bruschetta or crostini. So don't just have it for breakfast, it is the perfect party food too.<br></p><p>Serves 4 (or 2 if you're feeling greedy)<br></p><p><b>Ingredients</b>:<br>4 slices sourdough bread or good-quality rustic bread<br>50-60g blue cheese, such as stilton, gorgonzola or roquefort. (It also works with soft blue cheeses such as dolcelatte and cambozola.)<br>2-3 tbs runny honey<br></p><p>Lightly toast each side of the bread.<br></p><p>Sprinkle one side of the toast with cheese. Grill for about 1 minute or until the cheese is beginning to melt.<br></p><p>Drizzle over a little honey and serve immediately.<br></p><p><b>Tips</b>: If your honey isn't runny then put the jar (minus the lid) in the microwave and microwave on Medium-High in 10 second bursts until it begins to soften. Alternatively put the jar in a bowl with some boiling water. (You may have to refresh with more boiling water.) But after 10 minutes or so the honey will begin to loosen to drizzling point. Equally, honey is easier to drizzle if you run hot water over a metal spoon before dipping it into the honey jar, (assuming you are not using the stuff that comes in a squeezy bottle). Nice additions to your tartine are caramelised apples or pears, grilled figs, crisp bacon, cured meats or chopped nuts such as hazelnuts or walnuts. (Although possibly not all at once.)<br></p><h2>4. Blue cheese, leek and mushroom pasta bake</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-79417f1f-bb4d-43e8-a0d3-d5efae19e6fd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399567353272/c01d094b-2409-4135-8ed1-12c466130deb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"leftover cheese recipe: blue cheese leek and mushroom pasta bake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Blue cheese leek and mushroom pasta bake Photograph: /Rachel Kelly</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stilton is such a good cheese for cooking and works beautifully with the leeks and the nutty flavour of chestnut mushrooms, although most blue cheeses would work well. In this case I actually used a mixture of stilton, danish blue cheese and the last inch or a wedge of brie.<br></p><p>Serves 4<br></p><p><b>Ingredients</b>:<br>500g dried penne or rigatoni<br>1 tbsp olive oil<br>a knob of butter<br>1 leek, cleaned and sliced (use some of the more tender green parts)<br>125g chestnut mushrooms, sliced<br>75ml double cream<br>white wine<br>150g blue cheese (I used a mixture of stilton, danish blue and brie, but dolcelatte would be lovely too)<br>salt and freshly ground black pepper<br></p><p>Heat the oil in a large lidded saucepan. Add the butter. When it has melted, add the leeks. Gently cook over a low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the mushrooms and continue to cook with the lid on for another 5 to 8 minutes until the mushrooms have softened and are a golden brown. Stir occasionally.<br></p><p>While the leeks are cooking, cook the pasta in lightly salted boiling water according to the packet instructions, minus a couple of minutes. The pasta is better if it is slightly undercooked as you will be baking it. Drain, refresh with cold water and set aside.<br></p><p>Pre-heat the oven to 190C/Gas Mark 5.<br></p><p>When the vegetables are cooked add a generous splash of wine. Simmer for 2 minutes before stirring in the cream. Add three-quarters of the cheese and stir through until the cheese melts.<br></p><p>Remove from the heat<br></p><p>Stir until the cheese melts. Take off the heat.<br></p><p>Check the seasoning. (I love lots of black pepper.)<br></p><p>Tip in the cooked pasta and stir to coat. Transfer to an ovenproof dish. Dot with the remainder of the crumbled blue cheese. Cover the dish with foil and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes at 190C/Gas Mark 5 until the top is lightly browned. (I like it when some of the pasta is slightly charred and crisp.)<br></p><p>This is delicious served with a peppery green salad.<br></p><p><b>Tips</b>: Frozen peas would be a nice addition, as would cooked bacon or pancetta. Enrich the sauce by stirring a beaten egg into the cheese sauce before baking. Top with a mixture of seasoned breadcrumbs and grated parmesan cheese.</p><h2>Other recipe ideas for leftover blue cheese<br></h2><p><b>5</b>. If I am not eating Marmite on toast with a poached egg for breakfast, my second favourite thing to have is to crumble bits of blue cheese over toasted bread. Drizzle with honey and then grill until the cheese begins to melt. This works with most blue cheeses whether hard or soft, especially gorgonzola, roquefort, cambozola, stilton and dolcelatte. Or cut a baguette into rounds and make crostini or bruschetta - perfect party food.</p><p><b>6</b>.

The combination of having my <a href=\"http://youtu.be/tfY2agcBDJI\">heart broken by the film My Girl</a> in early childhood (a sad bee-related ending for a young and still-sweet Macaulay Culkin) and an unfortunate incident in Tanzania, where I disturbed a gigantic nest of African honeybees (believe me a remote island in the middle of Lake Victoria is the last place you want to be while you \"wait and see\" if you're allergic to bee stings), has not left me with the greatest affection for the creatures.</p><p>So when my editor asked if I’d like to do a course in beekeeping, at first I hesitated. But it's ridiculous to be afraid of bees. The course is on Kate Humble’s farm in the Wye Valley; a day-long <a href=\"http://www.humblebynature.com/courses-humble-by-nature/smallholding-animal-husbandry-courses/sustainable-bee-keeping\">Sustainable Beekeeping course</a>, where we will be told all about honeybees, how they live, the different hives you can use as well as other bits of bee paraphernalia, with expert instructors Nicola Bradbear and Janet Lowore from <a href=\"http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/\">Bees for Development</a>, an international charity based in nearby Monmouth. </p><p>As I head up to the farm I feel as if  a hive of bees are actually circulating in my stomach. The other people on the course have signed up for a variety of reasons. A lady from Woking already keeps chickens and is thinking about adding bees to her smallholding. One poor chap has tried keeping bees and already lost two colonies; one to pesticides, and one to the varroa mite. And then there is the bloke who has been dragged along by his wife: “I got stung once and I’m here for revenge,” he says. I think that he is probably onto something. </p><p>The number of beekeepers has increased dramatically since 2007. “At the time there was a move afoot for the government to cut funding to the <a href=\"https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/beebase/index.cfm\">National Bee Unit</a>,” says Gill Maclean from the British Beekeepers Association (BBKA). “We launched a big campaign highlighting this as a threat. In the end, the funding was not cut, but it also highlighted the importance of beekeepers and the number of BBKA members more than doubled.” There are now around 24,000 amateur beekeepers registered with the BBKA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8f3da3a4-c7d1-48c5-8425-f699bf86e287\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/13/1399975712590/135c5cc0-b58c-42a4-90c8-55ced591a880-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Live Better: Bees Gareth Baker\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Commercial beekeeper Gareth Baker shows different frames after introducing a new queen bee into the hive.  Photograph: Katherine Purvis</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rise comes against a background of growing international concern about the health of our global bee population. In the last decade beekeepers in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia and South America have reported horrifying stories of vanishing colonies; some commercial beekeepers have reported losses of up to 90% since the end of 2006, and no one could explain why. In 2007, Lord Rooker predicted the demise of the honeybee in Britain within a decade. In her book A World without Bees<i>, </i>Alison Benjamin explains the “economic and ecological disaster” we would face if bee colonies were to collapse completely. There would obviously be no honey and no beeswax, but we would also be without fruit (except for pineapples and bananas), vegetables, beef, pork, dairy, and coffee. Vital ingredients used to make medicines for arrhythmia and skin cancers would be lost, and the textile industry would face a scarcity or the entire disappearance of cotton and denim. That’s not to mention the environmental impact, loss of jobs, and loss of biodiversity. </p><p>The exact cause of the problem has been hotly disputed. The varroa mite – a virus-carrying parasite that preys on bees – is certainly partly to blame; it has been wiping out colonies worldwide for more than fifty years. And last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/09/honeybees-dying-insecticide-harvard-study\">new research by Harvard scientists</a> found that neonicotinoids – a type of insecticide – are likely to be the main cause of  what is termed colony collapse disorder. As the course leaders explain, practically everything we eat depends on pollination: “We all either eat plants or we're eating animals which have eaten plants,” explains Nicola. \"The plant can't walk over and mate with another plant – it has to have that agent of transport. Of course we know that wind is also an agent of transfer but insects are very important and amongst those insects, bees are very, very important.\"</p><p>After a couple of hours in the classroom learning about honeybees and the inner workings of a colony, it’s time to get kitted out in the customary attire. Dressed in a white jacket, netted hood and impenetrable gloves, and feeling more like a bumbling fencer than a confident apiarist, we wind our way around clusters of farm buildings to meet the bees. My nerves are jangling, but I try to make light of the less-than-comforting warnings from the instructors as we walk.</p><p>“Bees like to walk up your sleeves and up your trouser legs, so elastic bands are good if you have them.” I don’t. “If a bee does for some reason get in your hood, don’t panic. Walk away from the hive, open up your hood and just let it fly out.” Yeah, right. With that, we come to the hive at the edge of the barn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-92fd8f03-b99a-4cb7-99fd-bb525e4eb77d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/13/1399975939802/b7967f22-b94e-4056-981b-c36b4e9ef50b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Honeybee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Bees are vital to the world's eco system, including food crops. If all colonies collapsed there would be no fruit (except for pineapples and bananas), vegetables, beef, pork, dairy, or  coffee. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have been expecting a literal hive of activity, with the gentle sounds of buzzing and an overwhelming aroma of honey, but Wales is playing up to its meteorological stereotype that day and the gusts of wind and steady drizzle are keeping the bees firmly indoors. It takes a few warning puffs of sweet-smelling smoke, and then Nicola starts opening up one of Gareth Baker's commercial beehives, pulling out frames laden with honeycomb and hundreds of bees, and  passing them around for us to hold and inspect. The bees are deceptively silent, so much so that I don’t immediately notice them landing on my hands, or my arms, or my shoulders. My heart picks up a few beats, and then a few more, but I find myself offering to hold one of the frames. </p><p>The thing that is preoccupying me is the warning that bees release pheromones when they die. Those pheromones warn the rest of the colony that an attacker is in their midst, and that’s when the bees start to sting. Not wanting to end up like poor little Macaulay, I step forward cautiously and fumble through my oversized yellow rubber gloves, anxious to get a good grip on the frame without squishing a single bee. I’m not exactly terrified, but my heart is pounding in my chest. I fight an overwhelming urge to throw the frame to the ground and run away, as it vibrates gently under the weight of the bees working on the honeycomb. I manage to hold the frame for a couple of minutes before hastily passing it on to someone else. </p><p>But my heart is slowing down, and the fascination of the bees is getting to work on me. They are such extraordinary creatures; it’s no wonder they’ve been the source of ardent admiration for millennia. Their work ethic alone puts the most conscientious of us to shame. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-63977b38-a0c1-4f00-a767-5a3163774dee\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/13/1399975772418/6f513110-e9f9-4d22-8f8e-ed9180415e0d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Live Better: Bees Bev and Frank Hutchinson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Course participants Bev and Frank Hutchinson from Cornwall inspect the honeycomb. Photograph: Katherine Purvis</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The worker bees build the wax comb, they collect the food – the pollen and nectar – in order to feed the colony. They keep the inside of the nest warm, they clean it, they guard it, they take out debris and dead bodies – they're constantly working,” explains Janet. The female worker bees act as the thermoregulatory system for the hive too, keeping it at a constant 35C; collecting and distributing water if it’s too hot and gathering together to generate body heat if it’s too cold. They never sleep. No time.</p><p>And as for reproducing … once in her lifetime a queen bee will convene with around a dozen drones (male bees) from different colonies. They meet 15 to 20 metres above the ground in a drone congregation area for what can only be described as a bee orgy. She buzzes around collecting bee sperm then flies back to her hive where she spends the next three to four years laying eggs – 2,000 a day in peak periods – from that one blissful, hazy sex-fest of an afternoon. </p><p>As the gentle humming casts its spell, I begin to think that beekeeping could be quite a therapeutic hobby. I can picture myself on a warm summer day, sitting in the garden, lulled into tranquility by the soft sounds of buzzing as the worker bees fly in and out the hive, hopping from one flower to another. You could argue that it would even save a bit of money by harvesting honey and making beeswax candles.  But that, possibly, is missing the point. </p><p>“When it comes to bees, the value of honey and the value of beeswax is just nothing, nothing, nothing, compared to the value of pollination,” says Nicola. “If you have bees in your garden, your bees are pollinating the ecology where you live, and any honey you get is just a bonus, a minor bonus actually. You have bees and they're pollinating your habitat and that's far, far more important.”</p><p><i>The sustainable beekeeping course is run by <a href=\"http://www.humblebynature.com/\">Humble by Nature</a> near Penallt in the Wye Valley, Wales.</i></p><p><i>More information about bees can be found at the   <a href=\"https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/beebase/index.cfm\">National Bee Unit</a>.

Energy policy is fundamentally confused, he says. Politicians talk of decarbonising and decentralising our energy system,&nbsp;but the&nbsp;six large&nbsp;utility firms&nbsp;still have&nbsp;a stranglehold over energy policy –&nbsp;and all the money.&nbsp;Three years ago he was sitting at&nbsp;a pub table&nbsp;saying something had to be done,&nbsp;to take&nbsp;people back to the future,&nbsp;and give them&nbsp;control over&nbsp;their energy&nbsp;again.&nbsp;So&nbsp;off he went&nbsp;and did it.</p><p>At&nbsp;their&nbsp;energy shop on the high&nbsp;street,&nbsp;Jerry Clark, technical director, explained to me how Wren works. We're a one-stop shop for energy, he said. You may&nbsp;not be motivated by&nbsp;climate change, but if&nbsp;you want to know how to save money on your energy bills, come on in and we'll tell you your options. Wren&nbsp;then acts as a broker&nbsp;–&nbsp;finding installers to fit free&nbsp;insulation,&nbsp;solar panels and so on – and the customer pays&nbsp;a small&nbsp;finder's fee.</p><p>And what a success it has been. Already Wren has&nbsp;over 1,000 members in Wadebridge and the surrounding area, and has procured more than 200&nbsp;installations. There are&nbsp;solar panels&nbsp;on the laundrette and&nbsp;the wine shop now, and also&nbsp;on a local school that we visited&nbsp;–&nbsp;they're&nbsp;saving it&nbsp;at least&nbsp;£5,000 annually.</p><p>What's fascinating is that&nbsp;Wren even&nbsp;has its own&nbsp;currency,&nbsp;a beautifully decorated&nbsp;note&nbsp;given&nbsp;out like&nbsp;reward vouchers&nbsp;for a supermarket.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;accepted&nbsp;by&nbsp;independent&nbsp;shops in Wadebridge,&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;money&nbsp;in the town. The installers are local,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wren also&nbsp;donates to&nbsp;the food bank and other nearby&nbsp;community projects. They say there's about £1m in the local economy that wouldn't be there&nbsp;otherwise – now&nbsp;that's&nbsp;something.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a little strange to think, though,&nbsp;that Wren's&nbsp;success relies&nbsp;on&nbsp;its customers&nbsp;finding&nbsp;their energy options&nbsp;so&nbsp;difficult to decipher&nbsp;–&nbsp;from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/20/green-deal-plans-energy-efficient\" title=\"\">green deal</a> to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/09/renewable-heat-incentive-homeowners-money-oil\" title=\"\">renewable heat incentive</a>. It's great that&nbsp;they trust Wren to make sense of it all, but&nbsp;does the government really need to make things&nbsp;so complicated?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434580026'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/15/1397557847929/solar-power-panels-St-Bre-003.jpg' alt='solar power panels St Breock primary school, Wadebridge, Cornwall' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Solar power panels at St Breock primary school, Wadebridge, Cornwall. Left to right: Kevin Smith (Wren), Andy Atkins (Friends of the Earth) and Jerry Clark (Wren). Photograph: Friends of the Earth</figcaption></figure><p>Wren is also working to provide local and cooperatively-owned energy&nbsp;at community scale, with the energy generated being used to power nearby&nbsp;homes at a reduced price. And it is&nbsp;pioneering aspects of a smart grid that can cope with fluctuations in generation from&nbsp;renewables.&nbsp;</p><p>They just need&nbsp;to&nbsp;overcome grid connection issues, Clark explained. The National Grid can be very slow to connect individual renewable energy installations and can charge a high amount for it, making the real cost to investors and communities far greater&nbsp;than that&nbsp;of the actual&nbsp;installation.&nbsp;It would have&nbsp;cost Wren over £1m to install solar on one particular&nbsp;Wadebridge school&nbsp;–&nbsp;crazy, isn't it?</p><p>Wadebridge&nbsp;is working hard to become energy self-sufficient. By the end of this year&nbsp;around 89% of the energy used locally will be produced locally. But only about 3% of the energy being produced right now is through installations owned by local people.&nbsp;Wren hopes to bring more of the current and new generation into local ownership, with a goal of 30% by 2016. I looked down at it from the hillside:&nbsp;a fairly&nbsp;typical market&nbsp;town of fewer than 10,000 people, not renowned for its green credentials like neighbouring Totnes. If Wadebridge could go renewable, so could other towns like it&nbsp;– Wren estimates that&nbsp;a third of the country has&nbsp;the right size population, roof space, and sufficient surrounding land.</p><p>With everything I'd seen and heard, we headed to&nbsp;Devon. In Plymouth, I met&nbsp;Dave Garland, a&nbsp;director&nbsp;of <a href=\"http://www.plymouthenergycommunity.com\" title=\"\">Plymouth Energy Community</a>, and Alistair Macpherson, low-carbon city team leader at Plymouth city council.&nbsp;Their aim is to get solar panels onto&nbsp;at least 20 schools and community buildings&nbsp;in Plymouth&nbsp;over the next six months.&nbsp;</p><p>Plymouth city council has provided half&nbsp;the funding&nbsp;needed&nbsp;via a&nbsp;£500,000 low-cost loan&nbsp;–&nbsp;and the rest is being crowd-funded through a community share offer.&nbsp;In just over five weeks they have raised&nbsp;£484,000&nbsp;–&nbsp;with around&nbsp;58% of investors living in Plymouth. This is&nbsp;an amazing&nbsp;success.&nbsp;Partly&nbsp;it's&nbsp;down to its marketing budget;&nbsp;partly&nbsp;the council's endorsement. But&nbsp;what&nbsp;I really like&nbsp;is how accessible it is to ordinary people.&nbsp;The minimum share is just £50&nbsp;–&nbsp;and&nbsp;with a rate of return of 6% per year,&nbsp;far&nbsp;higher&nbsp;than an&nbsp;ISA,&nbsp;why wouldn't you?&nbsp;</p><p>Schools can&nbsp;make huge annual savings&nbsp;through solar panels, with half-price clean electricity that could well cover library costs;&nbsp;as&nbsp;a former teacher, Garland holds the&nbsp;issue close to his&nbsp;heart.&nbsp;I couldn't agree more:&nbsp;it's why&nbsp;Friends of the Earth is launching its own <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1m28iV3\" title=\"\">new&nbsp;campaign to help schools nationwide&nbsp;go solar</a>.</p><p>But there are technical and legal challenges to getting many energy&nbsp;projects&nbsp;off the ground.&nbsp;As Macpherson said, success comes with having three or four key&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;with lots of expertise and spare time. But many groups&nbsp;aren't this lucky, and that's when you need a council to step in, as has been the case&nbsp;in Plymouth.&nbsp;</p><p>Certainly I think Macpherson is&nbsp;correct to say that local authorities should encourage community energy projects by providing funding, or at least permission and expertise. They&nbsp;are good long-term investments on behalf of local people, and&nbsp;a practical way for councils to&nbsp;demonstrate their&nbsp;commitment and leadership towards&nbsp;reducing carbon emissions. But we need help from central government&nbsp;too, starting first and foremost&nbsp;with greater ambition for community energy.&nbsp;</p><p>There's huge potential for community energy&nbsp;in the UK and it&nbsp;could play a major&nbsp;role in shifting us on to&nbsp;renewables.&nbsp;According to a <a href=\"http://www.respublica.org.uk/item/The-Community-Renewables-Economy-Starting-up-scaling-up-and-spinning-out-zlbz\" title=\"\">report by the thinktank&nbsp;Respublica</a> in September last year&nbsp;, community energy accounts for 46%&nbsp;of all energy produced from renewables in Germany, while&nbsp;in the UK this&nbsp;figure stands at just 0.3%. It's hard to see why the <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/community-energy-strategy-launched-greater-ambition-needed_27012014\" title=\"\">government&nbsp;is keeping it on the&nbsp;sidelines</a> &nbsp;–&nbsp;unless it's worried about the&nbsp;threat&nbsp;to it poses to the big six energy companies and the fossil-fuel&nbsp;status quo.</p><p>The government must help&nbsp;people to&nbsp;start community energy projects, by making it easier to afford upfront costs.</p><p>The funding announced in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/power-to-the-people-government-boost-to-community-energy\" title=\"\">community energy strategy</a>&nbsp;- will only go so far.&nbsp;In Germany&nbsp;people can get low-interest community energy&nbsp;loans&nbsp;from their bank. I want to see these&nbsp;available on every UK high&nbsp;street. And community-owned installations should be given priority for grid connection, at a low, affordable cost.</p><p>The winners of the global&nbsp;race to decarbonise&nbsp;will be the countries that invest now&nbsp;in solar power. Solar is already&nbsp;cheaper than gas in many parts of the world; it should be a no-brainer for any government serious about reducing energy bills and increasing energy security in a way that doesn't add to carbon emissions&nbsp;–&nbsp;unlike fracking.</p><p>Community energy projects could go a long way towards providing solar&nbsp;in the UK, keeping down our energy bills, slashing&nbsp;carbon emissions, and boosting&nbsp;local economies.&nbsp;The government needs to act now to&nbsp;remove the barriers and empower ordinary people to launch a massive generation of new, clean energy projects.</p><p><em>Andy Atkins is executive director of </em><a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Friends of the Earth</em></a>.</p><p>Interested in finding out more about how you can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live-better\">live better</a>?
