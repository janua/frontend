It's an injustice, and it hurts higher education","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-01-24T12:30:01Z","body":"<p>I am what's called an adjunct. I teach four courses per semester at two different colleges, and I am paid just $24,000 a year and receive no health or pension benefits. Recently, I was profiled in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/20/nyregion/crowded-out-of-ivory-tower-adjuncts-see-a-life-less-lofty.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> as the face of adjunct exploitation, and though I was initially happy to share my story because I care about the issue, the profile has its limits. Rather than use my situation to explain the systemic problem of academic labor, the article personalized – even romanticized – my situation as little more than the deferred dream of a struggling PhD with a penchant for poetry. </p><p>But the adjunct problem is not about PhDs struggling to find jobs or people being forced to give up their dreams. The adjunct problem is about the continued exploitation of a large, growing and diverse group of highly educated and dedicated college teachers who have been asked to settle for less pay (sometimes as little as $21,000 a year for full-time work) because the institutions they work for have callously calculated that they can get away with it. The adjunct problem is institutional, not personal, and its affects reach deep into our culture and society.</p><p>Though there are tens of thousands of personal stories like mine of economic hardship and lives ruined or put on hold, it is not to these stories that we should turn when we consider the exploitation of adjuncts in academia, but to our universal sense of justice. For the continued exploitation of adjuncts is, to put it bluntly, nothing less than unjust. Here's why:</p><h2>1. Using adjuncts devalues higher education</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\">American Association of University Professors</a>, adjuncts and other contingent employees made up 70% of the faculty at American universities and colleges in 2007. Though the numbers differ drastically from one campus to the next, all but the most elite college students are being taught by overworked and underpaid adjunct lecturers. These faculty are essentially paid contractors, who come in, do a quick job, and then head out. Maintaining high standards and expectations, performing research, and providing honest and accurate assessment under such conditions is incredibly difficult, and the continued use of adjuncts is destroying the integrity and value of higher education.</p><h2>2. Paying adjuncts less creates a hierarchy within academia</h2><p>It is unjust because it creates an ugly hierarchy within academia that mirrors the increasingly gross divide within American society. While the private sector has seen a startling loss of living wage jobs, the erosion of benefits, and the destruction of unions, academia has undergone its own slow transformation. While the average faculty member makes anywhere between <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/faculty-salaries-data-2012/131431#id=144050\">$60,000 to $198,000</a> a year (frequently for a course load of two or three courses per semester) most adjuncts are paid somewhere between $2,500 to $4,000 per course. They also have little to no control over their course assignments, except to refuse offered courses (which can lead to less work and less pay) and they have absolutely no job security, meaning they are subject to sudden termination at the whims of department chairs and administrators, without any explanation or any process for grievance or appeal. </p><h2>3. Universities spend more on administration than teachers</h2><p>It is unjust because it takes power away from the practitioners of higher education – teachers and researchers – and puts it in the hands of administrators. While the academe has become increasingly reliant upon temporary and disposable adjuncts, who live in constant fear of poverty, the administrative classes within those institutions have steadily grown. As Benjamin Ginsberg documented in <a href=\"http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-fall-of-the-faculty-9780199782444;jsessionid=C89FB65942DABA11D810D58669C5FCCC?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters</a>, between 1985 and 2005 administrative spending increased by 85%, while administrative support staff increased by a dramatic 240%. Meanwhile spending on faculty increased by only around 50%. Such wasteful spending on non-essential staff is out of proportion to the actual goals of academic institutions, which are charged to teach and research, not administer. </p><h2>4. Using adjuncts betrays the students who are most in need </h2><p>The students who frequently need the most help – poor and working class students, first generation college students, and students of color – are also the ones most likely to be taught by adjuncts. It is no accident that the increased use of adjuncts followed quickly on the heels of a massive shift in the demography of college attendance in the late sixties and early seventies. As more and more working class people and people of color began attending public universities in California and New York, state funding was quickly reduced. Rather than continue to offer the best to these students, universities decided instead to expand the use of adjuncts. Just as the doors of academia were opened to the most underprivileged students, the feast of knowledge that lay behind was quietly hidden from view, and the paper plates and frozen dinners brought out instead.  </p><h2>5. Under-paying adjuncts makes full-time teaching unaffordable</h2><p>Lastly, it is unjust because it cynically manipulates the better angels of the human spirit – the desire to help and to share one's interests and values, to cultivate meaningful relationships, to inspire, and to teach – in order to save a few bucks. Like federal and state governments, which are expected to subsidize the wages of full-time fast food workers, adjuncts – who frequently subsidize their earnings with other jobs – are voluntarily underwriting the institutions they work for. Though many of these adjuncts would be thrilled to dedicate themselves exclusively to teaching, few of them can, because none of them can afford to. </p><p>Many people ask me why, given all of this, I would continue to work as an adjunct, but that is the wrong question to ask. The work I do is important, it's what I was trained to do, and there's a clear and growing demand for it. Rather than asking why adjuncts don't find other work, or why they don't \"just quit\" as so many well-meaning commentators have suggested, people should instead be asking colleges and universities why they think it's OK to pay so little for such important work.</p>","headline":"Are adjunct professors the fast-food workers of the academic world?","trailText":"<p><strong>James Hoff: </strong>Adjuncts are over-worked, underpaid and have little job security.

Who would have thought it? Had the global power summit been held just a few months ago, he would have undertaken that pilgrimage as acknowledged steward of an ailing, troubled economy. The story he might tell now permits a certain swagger.</p><p></p><p>There is now a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10593584/David-Cameron-hails-the-start-of-recovery-for-all.html\" title=\"\">\"recovery for all,\" he declares</a>, as analysts say the earnings of the majority are now increasing by more than inflation. Ministers point to new figures suggesting that all except the richest 10% had their <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25869001\" title=\"\">take-home wages increase by at least 2.5% once tax cuts were taken into account</a>.</p><p>Add to that the news about unemployment; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25841570\" title=\"\">now down to 7.1%</a>, and rising house prices, and the news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/23/interest-rate-rise-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">the Bank of England will not soon raise interest rates</a>, and one sees how the prime minister is able to frame a narrative about how the strictures of austerity are beginning to reap the benefits.</p><p></p><p>Those here who have witnessed the chaos in Whitehall and Westminster these past four years may look askance at the notion that the pieces of the jigsaw are being methodically assembled, but in Davos this will undoubtedly play well.</p><p></p><p>And what can one conclude from the strategising of recent days? That once again, it's about the economy, stupid! The debates on immigration and welfare may provide unpleasantly discordant mood music, but the real battleground will be about the state of the recovery and who can be relied upon to deliver it.</p><p></p><p>And therein lies a problem and a decision for Labour. Is it going to spend the next months talking the economy down while the Tories beam optimism? That's a trap best avoided. For all our cynicism, there is still superior force in the politics of hope. Optimism is a much more powerful electoral stimulant than pessimism. Labour cannot allow this to become a contest between Sunny Dave and Jeremiah Ed.</p><p></p><p>Of course Labour must flag up any deceit over the government's figures if they seem questionable. Already that is happening. The shadow treasury minister Cathy Jamieson insists the cheery figures on pay have been massaged and draw attention away from matters such as cuts to tax credits and child benefit, both of which have hit working families. She says that in fact real annual wages have fallen by £1,600 since 2010 and cites figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies indicating that \"families are on average £891 worse off as a result of tax and benefit changes since 2010\".</p><p></p><p>That is all well and good. But over and above any focus on the coalition's failings, Labour must have a coherent plan about how it will do better. The lack of that narrative is probably why Labour has so far failed to pull away in the polls and is now seeing its poll lead tighten. The latest ICM poll for the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/13/support-labour-shrinks-economic-recovery-icm-poll\" title=\"\">estimated the lead at just 3%</a>.</p><p></p><p>That said, the determinant will not, in fact be what politicians say, or even what the media say about the state of the economy. People's anger with politicians and the media is such that neither of us are fully believed anyway. The crucial factor will be whether or not people actually feel change for the better in their own lives, and the lives of their families and neighbours. Only then will they pay attention to politicians and the media, and whether what they hear chimes with their real-life experience.</p><p></p><p>It will be about the economy, but the real economy, and not the picture as drawn in the Westminster village or the high-powered salons of Davos. Seen in those terms, there is all to play for.</p>","headline":"All eyes on you now, Ed Miliband – what's the economic plan?","trailText":"<strong>Hugh Muir: First thoughts</strong>: Sunny Dave's optimism on the cost of living may just be spin, but how Miliband responds is vital.

Scotland's deputy first minster, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP, recently called upon Labour, Conservatives and the Lib Dems – the parties behind the Better Together vote no campaign – to set out their competing vision of a 21st-century Scotland. She never used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-17094333\" title=\"\">\"devo-max\"</a>, but she was clearly seeking to draw the Westminster parties on what concessions they'd be willing to offer the Scottish electorate if they chose to remain within the union.</p><p>The status quo is clearly not an option. And the idea that any future British prime minister could contemplate bringing the Scots back into the fold by diminishing the power of Holyrood is laughable. The Tories are still suffering from the damage done by Margaret Thatcher's dismissive attitude to Scottish self-determination.</p><p>For their part, the unionist parties have already outlined what might be on offer. Labour has suggested giving Holyrood control of income tax; the Lib Dems support the idea of fiscal autonomy; while the Conservatives say they are committed to \"a strengthening of devolution\".</p><p>Implicit in this willingness to cede more powers to the Scottish parliament is a recognition by Westminster that devolution is beneficial to civic society. The obvious question that arises from such a conclusion is when will they offer those same benefits to the people of England?</p><p>The English Question is never directly addressed by our political establishment. The Tories might make noises about \"English votes for English laws\" but any poking around behind that slogan merely reveals a shabby attempt to undermine a future Labour majority. The debates over independence appear to be conducted between Scottish separatists on one side and British unionists on the other. No one seems willing to speak for England.</p><p>The situation is not helped by the cultural blind spot suffered by those living south of the border. As the Scots are fond of pointing out, the English suffer from an inability – or is it unwillingness? – to discern a difference between Britain and England. They may sing Jerusalem at the Last Night of the Proms, but it is Rule Britannia that really gets the English waving their flags.</p><p>Part of the problem lies in the fact that, unlike the Scots, we have no border between us and Westminster, so an English parliament seems like just another level of local government, rather than a symbol of national self-determination. And because the English state is so much larger, it is questionable whether citizens far from the centre of power would feel the benefits of devolution in the same way their Celtic neighbours do. Would an English parliament of 53 million be any more representative of those of us who live in the south west than is the UK parliament of 63 million?</p><p>If we in England want to experience the level of local autonomy seen in Scotland, then we need to introduce borders between Westminster and ourselves. The nine regions of England have an average population of about 5 million, similar in size to Scotland and sufficient to provide a tax base big enough to fund the kind of strategic spending that is difficult to sustain at a county level.</p><p>Critics will be quick to point out that regional government was rejected by the people of the north-east a decade ago, but go back and read the reports and you'll see that this was in part because voters didn't feel that Labour's proposals actually amounted to self-government. Westminster just couldn't contemplate real localism for England.</p><p>Offer the people of the south-west a regional assembly with the same powers as those currently enjoyed by the Scottish parliament and I believe there would be broad support, especially if it was backed up with a regional development bank. Devolving power to the nine English regions would also provide the rest of the country with the means by which to moderate the economic power of London.</p><p>It has become clear over the past decade that the gravitational pull of the capital is distorting our economy. This week a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/20/tuc-employment-recovery-restricted-to-south-east\" title=\"\">TUC study reported</a> that George Osborne's widely trumpeted recovery is restricted to the south-east. The London-based financial sector has captured the institutions of our state, leaving us with a political class who are more willing to devolve power to the bond markets than to their own citizens.</p><p>An English parliament, wherever it was based, would still be dominated by the economic imperatives of the City of London, meaning that market-based solutions will continue to be unquestionably followed, no matter what their implications for our communities. Regional assemblies, acting in concert to challenge London's power, offer us a better chance of ensuring that the benefits of growth reach every part of the country.</p><p>The campaign for Scottish independence is, in part, an attempt to break with the Thatcherite agenda and create a new settlement that puts people before profit. Those in England who believe that our own society needs to be rebalanced along similar lines should wake up and join the debate.</p>","headline":"Devolve power to England's

For several half days each week, outside of normal school hours, they teach the refugee children.</p><p>These teachers are unpaid volunteers who are taking children off the streets, preventing many from becoming child labourers or even beggars, and already doing what only education can do – providing the children with hope that there is a future worth preparing for.</p><p>Now, a small Scottish charity, <a href=\"http://www.edinburghdirectaid.org/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh Direct Aid</a> – moved by their plight and aware that the language of Lebanese education is French and English and that Syria is Arabic – is delivering textbooks in Arabic to the school and have offered to fund timeshare projects across the country.</p><p>The Akroum experiment is a small illustration of what can be done to meet the educational needs of children in the most appalling of situations. It challenges the international community to support a big idea: for the first time in conflict zones providing universal education provisions on a similar basis for all 400,000 school-age children who are now Syrian refugees in Lebanon. By using 1,500 schools dotted across Lebanon in areas where refugees are huddled in tents, prefabricated huts and tenements, this could be achieved.</p><p>With the support of the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, and the education campaigner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/12/malala-yousafzai-calls-free-education\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, an ambitious plan has been drawn up costing $195m (£117m) a year to repeat across Lebanon what the Akroum school and the Syrian exiled teachers have achieved for one small area.</p><p>The simplicity of the concept, crafted by Kevin Watkins, director of the UK-based Overseas Development Institute, is that it can be operational within weeks. Instead of having to build new camp schools for refugees, exiled Syrian children will use existing Lebanese schools on this two-shift system. Members of the public have an opportunity to personally donate to make the plan a reality through any one of 500,000 Western Union outlets throughout the world, with the money transfer company matching the first $100,000 (£60,000) donations.</p><p>Lebanon is dealing with a refugee crisis on an unimaginable scale. Half of the 2 million Syrians already displaced from their country have fled for neighbouring Lebanon, where they make up one in four of the population. Every month an additional 50,000 make the same journey.

Of all the dark places, nowhere is more obscure than inside the black box of pension funds. Virtually no one understands their pension scheme. Even those who think they do can't know what is shrouded in secrecy: the real charges paid over a lifetime, hidden in the dark where City burglars prosper.</p><p>Yesterday, faced with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25860239\" title=\"\">mass obstruction of the pensions industry</a> – in effect the entire City – the government beat a hasty retreat. Sneaking out a written statement and avoiding questions, Steve Webb, the pensions minister, backed away from capping the charges imposed by pension funds, most of them secret. To understand the full force of this U-turn, here's what Webb boldly announced last October: he would conduct <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/29/pensions-minister-full-frontal-assault-rip-off-schemes-webb\" title=\"\">\"a full frontal assault\" on the pensions industry</a>. He calculated someone saving £100 a month all their working life could see \"the huge sum of £160,000\" lost in charges. \"Enough is enough,\" he said, urging \"an outright ban on all charges above 0.75%\".</p><p>That too was a U-turn. Ed <a href=\"http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/miliband-attacks-pension-and-bank-charges/1044559.article\" title=\"\">Miliband named pension funds in his attack on \"predatory capitalism\"</a>, warning charges were the next big scandal, with a cartel of just four insurers controlling 70% of the industry in myriad schemes. The Association of British Insurers protested that his \"scaremongering about charges runs the risk of putting off many people from saving into a pension.\" Webb agreed, calling Miliband \"irresponsible\" for \"stirring up cheap headlines\", sneering: <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2013/10/building-a-pensions-system-people-can-trust-another-victory-for-labour/\" title=\"\">\"Why doesn't the government set a price cap on a tin of beans?\"</a></p><p>But he abruptly spun round as the wind changed with a surge of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/19/oft-retirement-savings-poor-value-pension-schemes\" title=\"\">pensions critics, including the Office of Fair Trading</a>, some leading Tories and a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-369633/Pensions-A-crisis.html\" title=\"\">campaign in the Daily Mail</a>. With new reforming zeal, Webb compared pension companies to the innkeeper in Les Misérables – \"<a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/liblink-steve-webb-issue-of-pension-charges-has-been-neglected-for-too-long-36980.html\" title=\"\">Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice, two per cent for looking in the mirror twice</a>\" – as he accused them of \"ever more inventive ways of extracting money from their clients\". He quoted the OFT's discovery of <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oft.gov.uk%2Fshared_oft%2Fmarket-studies%2Foft1505&amp;ei=oGDhUsz-FseN7AaEu4HwBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGi3ayVAZJ5rXhiAOM2sixHaOAs2w&amp;sig2=--b3aKQkhIr4F6pk-sLX1Q&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.ZGU\" title=\"\">18 different sorts of charges</a> as fund managers churn shares to skim commissions.</p><p>But the pension funds have had the last laugh, with Webb's sheepish statement that, contrary to his promise, \"any cap on charges will not be introduced before April 2015\". No one thinks he will introduce them in the middle of an election campaign, either. It's a dead duck on the dust heap of Department for Work and Pensions disasters. Responding to U-turn headlines, the DWP hastened out another statement late yesterday: in April 2015 there will be a cap, size unknown, but only on auto-enrolled pensions.</p><p>Here's why this matters more than ever. Auto-enrolment – relying on inertia to enrol every employee into a pension scheme – is already being rolled out. Sharp-eyed critics warn this may become a <a href=\"http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/tory-mp-fears-auto-enrolment-misselling-scandal/1059335.article\" title=\"\">massive mis-selling scandal</a>, as the low-paid find hidden charges eating up their small pensions. Many risk no gain at all if their pension falls below the threshold for the minimum pension guarantee when they retire, losing everything. The only gainers will be the government and the pensions industry. That's grand theft mis-selling.</p><p>Miliband will return to his first critique of the industry, aided by Gregg McClymont, his astute pensions shadow minister, who has relentlessly dogged Steve Webb through the labyrinthine pensions undergrowth. Calling pensions  a \"broken market\", McClymont presciently predicted that the government would never stand up to this greatest of vested interests.</p><p>Drawing up their own policy, Labour should study a <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/publications/reports/costly-and-ineffective-why-pension-tax-reliefs-should-be-reformed/\" title=\"\">radical paper by Michael Johnson – former Cameron policy adviser and investment banker turned gamekeeper – from the Conservative Centre for Policy Studies</a> . Titled Costly and Ineffective, it's so radical and egalitarian that it caused the resignation of CPS board members, including Lord Forsyth, doyen of many a City investment bank and insurance company who was reportedly \"apoplectic\" at what he called a \"Stalinist\" policy. No surprise, for it proposes the demolition of the pensions industry.</p><p>The paper pulls the rug from under the rationale for most tax reliefs, exposing vast sums the Treasury could claw back. Relief on contributions, national insurance, tax-exempt lump sums and others amounts to a phenomenal £48.4bn a year. Half all tax relief goes to the top 8% earning over £50,000, who need no incentives. Just abolishing higher-rate relief would bring in £7bn.</p><p>The crucial point is that the young no longer trust pensions. Now defined benefits are dead, no one knows what they will get for locking away cash in high-charging funds until the age of 70: paying off university debt and buying a home come first. Pensions as we knew them are over: when interest rates rise, many now auto-enrolled may drop out. The industry claims tax relief is just tax deferred until retirement, but Johnson shows how only one in seven higher earners ever pays it back, as most pay only basic rate once retired. What's more, charges snatched by the industry amount to more than the tax relief. This is benefit dependency for the City.</p><p>Johnson proposes something more attractive and fairer to all. Pensions and ISAs should be rolled into one, allowing savers to withdraw money as they like. The Treasury would add £1 for every £1 saved, equal relief for all, but anyone taking out cash before retirement would lose the Treasury contribution. It would cost less than today's relief and make saving understandable and attractive, with transparency on charges. His conclusion is devastating: the pension system is \"hugely expensive\", \"ineffective\" and \"skewed towards the wealthy\"; failing to create a savings culture in the young is \"exacerbating the looming generational inequality\". Most tax relief is anyway \"captured by the industry.\"</p><p>Such radical reform would, says Johnson, \"require preparedness to confront deeply entrenched vested interests within the savings industry\". But the government has just failed that test, even on the modest first step of capping pension charges stolen from the \"hardworking\" to line City silk purses.</p><p>The pension bill now in parliament has no cap, or transparency on charges. On Monday Lord Lawson, putting forward amendments similar to Labour's, demanded compulsory disclosure and independent supervision, complaining that \"the foxes are regulating the hen coop\". Here was a former Tory chancellor – a Tory chancellor! – saying: \"There is absolutely no correlation between investment management fees and performance\" – adding that \"portfolios are being deliberately churned to generate commissions\". That's Ed Miliband's tune. Is anyone surprised this government has caved in?</p>","headline":"Steve Webb's pensions U-turn is a dead duck on the dust heap of disasters","trailText":"<p><strong>Polly Toynbee:</strong> The

Our fertile land, clean air and water underpin our country’s agricultural heritage, which has fed and clothed us.</p><p>Australia’s native wildlife is unique, and the bush where Australians walk, fish, hunt and camp is habitat for the animals that are emblems of the country itself. Traditional owners of the country have the longest continuing culture in the world, and a connection to the bush that goes back tens of thousands of years.</p><p>And then there’s the Australian character: tough, wry, tending to side with the underdog and not afraid of a fight to defend what matters to us. &nbsp;</p><p>In the battle that is gripping my community this coming&nbsp;Australia Day, my fifth generation farming family and I are siding with the underdogs against Big Coal.

The company has <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/epbc/epbc_ap.pl?name=current_referral_detail&amp;proposal_id=5566\">approval</a> to build a new <a href=\"http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/activists-blockade-maules-creek-mine-site-as-prote\">13m tonne per year open cut coal mine</a>, the largest new mine in NSW.</p><p>Out here at Maules Creek, we face a <a href=\"http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/the-coal-mine-and-maules-creek-ecological-haven-or-whitehaven/816/\">make-or-break fight</a> to defend the core things we value: our forest, land, water and air, our community, and our ability to farm the land. Having exhausted all official avenues, we are rising up as a community this Australia Day weekend and putting ourselves on the line to blockade the mine site.</p><p>The Maules Creek coal mine will drop the water table we depend on for our livelihood by five metres.

There is also a request pending <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/minister-failed-to-act-on-maules-creek-mine-stopwork-order-20140117-30yep.html\">for a protection order</a> for Aboriginal cultural

underway.&nbsp;How is it that the devastating land clearing for this mine can begin when these issues are not settled?&nbsp;Why is the construction work still underway?<br></p><p>Environment minister Greg Hunt has the power to revoke Whitehaven’s approval and end the conflict that is dividing our community.&nbsp;We see it as our duty to protect our irreplaceable natural assets, our land and future generations from this destructive mine.&nbsp;At our blockade on Australia Day, we’ll be proud, united Australians, fighting like our forebears for what really matters.</p>","headline":"This Australia

The flaw the high-schooler discovered is commonly known as a MySQL error, and it is ridiculously simple to fix. With teenage curiosity at play, Joshua Rogers managed to access the government server, using a process known as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\">SQL injection</a>.</p><p>Due to the PTV’s security oversight, databases of personal information of over 600,000 users –&nbsp;including full names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and nine digits of their credit cards –&nbsp;were accessible online. And if the young wunderkind&nbsp;could access those databases, it meant that&nbsp;far more nefarious and potentially criminal types could&nbsp;illicitly access&nbsp;the databases as well.</p><p>Legally, Joshua wasn’t required to inform PTV,&nbsp;but ethically he thought it was the right thing to do. So he kindly emailed PTV’s staff on 26 December&nbsp;to inform them of the flaw in their security.</p><p>PTV’s response was less than adequate.&nbsp;Not a well-deserved “thank you”&nbsp;(although PTV did acknowledge Joshua’s initial email after a journalist came asking some pointy questions about the data breach), and not even a courtesy email to PTV customers to let them know their personal information had been breached and was potentially at risk of being fraudulently used. No, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/security-it/hacked-site-reports-boy-to-police-20140108-hv7tl.html\">a statement PTV made to The Age</a>, they \"referred the matter to Victoria Police.\"</p><p>Victoria Police&nbsp;declined to comment on whether&nbsp;their investigation will specifically&nbsp;involve an examination of Joshua's&nbsp;amateur pen testing of PTV’s network.&nbsp;In a statement made to The Guardian, they&nbsp;stated that they’d \"received a report from Public Transport Victoria relating to the unauthorised access to their network. As the matter is currently under investigation, we are not in a position to comment.\"&nbsp;</p><p>How is it that&nbsp;PTV’s potentially disastrous lack of basic online security cops nothing more than a well-deserved swipe from tech journos rather than a hefty fine for failing to notify customers, while a&nbsp;young&nbsp;infosec enthusiast doing the right thing&nbsp;may face an&nbsp;investigation?</p><p>While&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-reports/oaic-community-attitudes-to-privacy-survey-research-report-2013%23_Toc368300741\">96% of Australians want mandatory data breach notification laws</a>, Australian companies aren’t currently&nbsp;legally required to disclose data breaches to customers, even when people’s personal details are potentially compromised.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aph.gov.au%2FParliamentary_Business%2FBills_Legislation%2FBills_Search_Results%2FResult%3FbId%3Dr5059&amp;ei=rLnhUsTgDI6ykgWxvIHABg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_RRKc5LnIsSfWlbjUU3rsZUHKcg&amp;sig2=6V5KDSbsYfX6dlkNYmv4Tw&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2013</a> lapsed in November after the federal election, despite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.efa.org.au/2013/10/11/mandatory-data-breach-notification-legislation/\">support</a>&nbsp;from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Australian Privacy Commissioner and public interest groups including Electronic&nbsp;Frontiers&nbsp;Australia and the Australian Privacy Foundation. Despite&nbsp;this show of hand,&nbsp;Coalition senators Gary Humphries and Sue Boyce raised&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mumbrella.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Senate-report-on-Privacy-Act.pdf\">objections to the bill</a>, claiming that&nbsp;“&nbsp;stakeholders should be better scrutinised, understood and acted upon by the relevant government agencies as this new privacy regime is rolled out.”</p><p>Those stakeholders, who kicked and screeched in horror at the legislation attempts to increase accountability and implement fines for failures to protect and notify customers of data breaches, included data-miners whose bread and butter has always been paid by sucking up personal information online, as well as telephone&nbsp;companies&nbsp;the previous government attorney-general Mark Dreyfus essentially&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/05/sony-vodafone-and-telstra-called-out-as-attorney-general-unveils-data-breach-laws/\">took a stick to</a>&nbsp;over prior data breaches.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a problematic imbalance in the evolution of Australian policy and practice in response to data breaches: individuals who report critical security flaws face potential legal action, while corporations who fail to fix and report data breaches to paying customers go unpunished.</p><p>Threatening to call the police on people who report security flaws has a chilling effect against encouraging good citizenship. Reporting a dangerous hole in a public road isn’t illegal, and similarly we shouldn’t threaten&nbsp;people who point out potential holes in infosec, particularly when breaches put sensitive information at risk.</p><p>Today, a simple Google search for '“inurl:.gov.au \"this document is confidential”' raises approximately thousands of&nbsp;responses on Australian government websites with potentially confidential documents. In light of heavy-handed responses to innocent individuals who report security issues, who would be game to open the links to check and see if the documents are legitimately available to the public, or unwittingly released online?&nbsp;Who would be foolhardy enough to report critical breaches of confidentially, when pointing out security failures potentially garners the reward of a knock on the door from the police?</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b06cbfe8-545e-4727-843a-dd1904e73be3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390523862433/a7a2ff1f-d621-4e32-9bff-1f13a6ed6172-460x276.png\" alt=\"inurl:.gov.au \"this document is confidential\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A search for \"inurl:.gov.au \"this document is confidential\".</figcaption> </figure> <p>It is vital that an amnesty is implemented against prosecution of individuals who report security flaws.

Crime is now at its lowest level since 1982, the year the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/period-ending-september-2013/stb-crime-in-england-and-wales--year-ending-sept-2013.html#tab-Overall-level-of-crime\" title=\"\">crime survey</a> was introduced to bring a wider measure of people's experience of crime in the preceding year. That year of their first survey was memorable – the austerity budget, riots, strikes and a national panic about law and order. And its report, showing there were nearly four times more crimes than traditional police figures suggested, seemed to confirm the alarm. At the Tory party conference that year, then an annual festival for hangers and floggers, the future minister Edwina Currie was cheered wildly as she waved a pair of handcuffs from the rostrum.</p><p>Understanding the reasons behind this dramatic turnaround appears, on the face of it, to be a rare moment to be able to study a successful government policy. The latest quarterly report shows that eight million crimes were committed between September 2012 and September 2013, down from just under 10 million in 2011. The coalition, which has – like its predecessors – been passing crime-related legislation at the rate of <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga?page=6\" title=\"\">approximately one act a year</a>, duly claimed credit and possibly sighed with relief, given the big cuts in spending on law and order. But even a glance at the trend behind the headlines suggests crime and policing policy has less influence on the figures than politicians want to believe. Crime has been falling since 1995, and looks set to carry on falling, whether counted by the Office for National Statistics' crime survey, or the police records that the ONS says it can no longer authenticate in the wake of evidence suggesting what the chief inspector of constabulary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/18/police-crime-figures-manipulation-chief-inspector\" title=\"\">Tom Winsor, politely called manipulation</a>.</p><p>But if not government policy, then what, criminologists and <a href=\"http://www.ukjusticepolicyreview.org.uk/what-we-ve-been-up-to\" title=\"\">justice specialists</a> wonder? The detail contains some of the answers: crimes such as vandalism, burglary and car theft, which once made up a large part of total crime, have fallen steeply – due to better-designed and lit public areas and more sophisticated security. Harder to grapple with is the rise within the overall figures of some types of crime. Shoplifting – which might be exacerbated by austerity – is up slightly overall, but has risen significantly in regions such as the West Midlands and Merseyside. Cause, or mere correlation? Reported domestic violence, which appears more prevalent when times are hard, is rising. But – like historic sex abuse – it is also a crime to which police forces are more sensitive than they were.</p><p>Many would say it's prison, stupid. Rising prison populations track falling crime numbers. Maybe. But it's a pricey option. More and more evidence – from Norway <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/04/alternatives-incarceration-prison-numbers\" title=\"\">to New York</a> – shows ideas like restorative justice and drug treatment do it better – and cheaper.</p>","headline":"Crime figures: number crunching","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The trend behind the headlines suggests crime and policing policy has less influence than politicians want to believe","newspaperPageNumber":"32","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m64h","wordcount":"462","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427896503","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8591957","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Editorial","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031848","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T00:10:46Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/24/crime-figures-policing-policy-editorial","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/24/crime-figures-policing-policy-editorial","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/society","references":[]},{"id":"society/prisons-and-probation","webTitle":"Prisons and probation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/prisons-and-probation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/society/prisons-and-probation","references":[]},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/police","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/police","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/editorial","webTitle":"Editorial","r2ContributorId":"56303","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367609515569/guardianlogo_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Editorials from the Guardian.

The public mood is clearly that the Iraq war was a failure and that the Afghanistan campaign is going nowhere. That jaundiced view boiled over in the rejection of military intervention in Syria last summer. It hardly seems likely to be reversed by the Chilcot report on Iraq. So it is not surprising that senior sources in the MoD should therefore conclude that the public lacks enthusiasm for, and would perhaps not tolerate, British soldiers joining with the Americans in a similar intervention any time soon. The real surprise would be if they had formed any other view.</p><p>There is no doubting that the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan help to make life difficult for the generals in other ways, too. The public's mood coincides with a long period of public spending cuts. The Treasury sniffs the doubting political breeze, and therefore sees the chance to make savings in a department with a relatively large budget – <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221885/budget2013_complete.pdf\" title=\"\">£40bn this year</a> – and relatively little prospect of new large spending. On Thursday <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/final-tranche-of-armed-forces-redundancies\" title=\"\"> the defence secretary announced</a> another 1,505 armed forces redundancies, mainly in the army, the fourth such announcement since the coalition took office. For all that, few would bet against further cuts after the general election.</p><p>But it won't do for the politicians and service chiefs simply to blame the public for the fact that they must operate in reduced circumstances. A significant part of the problem the MoD faces is of its own devising. It is not the public that has decided to press ahead with the Trident nuclear weapons replacement programme – <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN06526/update-on-the-trident-successor-programme\" title=\"\">official cost £15-20bn</a>. Nor is it the voters who are responsible for the fact that the UK is building two new aircraft carriers – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/04/aircraft-carriers-cost-6bn\" title=\"\">official cost currently £6.2bn</a>. These are choices made at the top, and they inevitably constrain other defence spending options. Add in the ministry's unenviable but justified reputation for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/14/ministry-of-defence-failed-computer-system\" title=\"\">wasteful spending</a> and there can be little dispute that the MoD is the author of its own fate, whether for good or ill. If the public shares some responsibility for these questionable priorities, that is ascribable to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/16/leader-comment-military-options-sense-about-defence\" title=\"\">lack of serious political debate</a> about UK defence options rather than to anything else.</p><p>One of the threads that winds through this unsatisfactory story is Britain's often blundering response to the genuine external and internal security challenge posed to this country, among others, by the 9/11 and other terror attacks. But it was not just the military response that miscued. It was the domestic security response, too. On Thursday a report by the parliamentary <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/human-rights-committee/news/tpims-substantive/\" title=\"\">joint committee on human rights</a> found some of the toughest counter-terrorism powers (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24803069\" title=\"\">known as TPim orders</a>) are simply \"withering on the vine\". It questioned whether the powers are of the practical use claimed by government. The committee rightly calls for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/23/uk-counter-terrorism-powers-review-watchdog\" title=\"\">a thorough re-examination and review</a> of all such powers after the election.</p><p>There is a resonantly important common theme here. In both cases, military and security, the response to 9/11 and jihadist terrorism has been massive and expensive. In both cases it has been of debatable effectiveness. In some respects, but not all, the policies have been counter-productive, feeding the radicalism not starving it. To say that is not, in any way, to dismiss the seriousness of the threat or the need for effective responses. It is, though, to question the effectiveness of what has been done, whether in the mountains of Afghanistan or the streets of British cities. We will continue to need effective defences to protect our people and deter our enemies, just as we will need effective anti-terror laws for the same reason. In both cases, the need is for strategies that work better than the current ones have done – and for a calmer and more objective debate about what these should be. Hopefully, that is beginning to be possible.</p>","headline":"Anti-terrorism strategies: the case for thinking differently","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The response to 9/11 and jihadist terrorism has been massive, expensive and of debatable effectiveness","newspaperPageNumber":"32","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m64g","wordcount":"686","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427896352","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8591963","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Editorial","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031847","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T23:55:28Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/23/anti-terrorism-strategies-editorial","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/23/anti-terrorism-strategies-editorial","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uksecurity","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/editorial","webTitle":"Editorial","r2ContributorId":"56303","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367609515569/guardianlogo_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Editorials from the Guardian.

In partnership with IndigenousX, we're inviting its weekly host to tell us about who they are, what issues they're passionate about, and what they have in store for us during their upcoming week. &nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Tell us about yourself. Who are you, where are you from, what do you do?</b></h2><p>I am a Yuwallarai woman from northwest NSW. I’m 46 years old, a daughter, a sister, an aunty and – Aboriginal way – a mother and grandmother. I currently spend my time between Sydney and Lismore in NSW, but \"home\" is Goodooga in the northwest of the state, where many of my family members live.&nbsp;</p><p>I was raised in a safe and loving environment by my Aboriginal mum (herself the oldest of 18 children) and non-Aboriginal dad, both of whom always told me, my sister and two brothers that we could be and do anything we wanted.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;\">A generation ago, many of my family were stationhands, shearers, jackaroos and jillaroos, and domestic servants. Today, we have a teacher, a writer, community and youth workers, a police officer, a surveyor amongst our number.&nbsp;</span></p><p>For the past 25 years, I have worked in print and radio journalism, communications, and management of Indigenous organisations.&nbsp;In July this year,&nbsp;I&nbsp;was elected co-chair of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnationalcongress.com.au%2F&amp;ei=W5ThUuG3KsXCkgXKnYDYBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuANaAgC8UaAlB7U0ArMCQ-xVPsw&amp;sig2=VUFA7VsaX1i2Jx9kEYXWwQ&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples</a>, a national representative voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I’m also a director of <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reconciliation.org.au%2F&amp;ei=bZThUv29JYH1lAX30YHQDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGslpBWb6z0-Z4uYAjyZQPKhnA8eg&amp;sig2=yESCvF53EODOUtfy3JsWmQ&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Reconciliation Australia</a> and a member of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deadlys.com.au%2Fvote%2Fcriteria-nominating-and-voting-in-the-deadlys%2F&amp;ei=fpThUpL3INGlkgW7noDoAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWIPC-QSB5iFCeoOqrLgPfplArgg&amp;sig2=v0hKQHPbzzf-9VQCQo__eA&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Deadly Awards Executive Academy</a>.</p><h2><b>What do you plan to talk about on @IndigenousX this week?</b></h2><p>I’m privileged to meet and know many people who strive towards a robust, fair and just Australia. I want to highlight ideas and the work we can all do to address and meet that challenge. This week encompasses&nbsp;26 January, a day when I personally celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ survival, and a day I believe presents an opportunity for all Australians to acknowledge the nation’s historical truths and collectively dream about a better shared future.&nbsp;</p><p>It’ll also be a big week for the Congress, with some public meetings around the country serving as vital rallying points to assure our members and supporters that Congress will survive even if the federal government follows through on plans not to honour a previous budget funding commitment covering the next three years. Congress is owned and operated by&nbsp;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander&nbsp;Peoples. As such, our future is in our own hands. Now, more than ever, we need to build a national unity movement.</p><h2><b>What issue(s) affecting Indigenous peoples do you think is most pressing?</b></h2><p>Achieving justice and respect – in every realm – for our inherent rights as First Peoples. I’m especially passionate about keeping families together and on country; keeping our stories and identity strong; combatting racism; addressing the over-incarceration of our peoples; and ensuring through education and capacity building that we’re in the best possible shape physically, mentally, spiritually and economically to meet the challenges ahead.</p><h2><b>Who are your role models and why?</b></h2><p>There are so many, from our early warriors and resistance fighters to the likes of Aboriginal rights activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAnthony_Fernando&amp;ei=5ZThUt-mHoLilAXRv4CgCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4o-tXLj0KbTY5l1r-DeqknJxH-Q&amp;sig2=wRQSGLuFpbcJptlX9lMBbg&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Anthony Martin Fernando,</a><b>&nbsp;</b>American civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks, the <a href=\"http://indigenousrights.net.au/section.asp?sID=33\">1965 Freedom Riders</a>, everyone who helped to establish the first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled organisations, the late <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Mabo\">Eddie Mabo,</a> and my own mum the late Pam Parker (née Lamb), who went to school for little more than a year but educated herself enough to run two businesses and go to university.&nbsp;</p><p>I am inspired by all good, honest, dignified and courageous women and men who won’t wait for others to do what’s right, and who will put self-interest aside and act for the most vulnerable in society. As well as the big issues, I also advocate small but mighty acts of kindness, like asking someone who seems sad, worried or frightened \"are you okay?\" and listening genuinely to their answer (sometimes people just need someone to hear them). Or, if you see someone copping abuse on a train, moving to sit or stand beside them – silently if that’s all you’re comfortable with – so they know they’re not alone. Often the people who are most generous are those with the least to give.</p><h2><b>What are your hopes for the future?</b></h2><p>I hope for vibrant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and families that are valued and secure, where we celebrate success and diversity in every sphere of life, learn from mistakes, and believe in ourselves. We’re often told – by ourselves and others – that we must choose one way or the other but I believe that we should be able to avail ourselves of every possible and principled means to make our lives better and build stronger, respectful relationships. I dream of a future where our children’s horizons are endless.</p>","headline":"Q&A with  Kirstie Parker: on acts of kindness and Indigenous survival","trailText":"<b>IndigenousX:</b>&nbsp;Each week, a new guest hosts the @IndigenousX Twitter account.

Sunderland is not the only one in despair","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T00:06:29Z","body":"<p>Half a lifetime ago, in a nondescript pub on a Monday night, I saw something that made me believe everything didn't have to stay the same. That the promise of success needn't be followed by disappointment. That the good times hadn't ended in the 1960s, with the hippies and the music and the dreamers. Instead, on a screen above me, a pre-lapsarian Ryan Giggs was curling in a 30-yard free kick and Manchester United were, for the first time since the scarcely credible Best-Charlton-Law days, champions. It was possible to be alive, United and win.</p><p>Fast forward 20 years, and you can stick the lid back on. With the United empire crumbling, the indignities mount daily. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/05/wilfried-bony-swansea-fa-cup-victory-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Swanseas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25740123\" title=\"\">Sunderlands</a> do not fear to triumph at Old Trafford, and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/02/howard-webb-manchester-united_n_4529834.html\" title=\"\">referees like Howard Webb</a> brandish red cards at United players as if they had been doing it all their lives. Suddenly, the fortunes I solipsistically identified with United's own look set to be shanked into oblivion. My back aches. The roof leaks. A <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-crisis-david-moyes-3047909\" title=\"\">Moyes-life crisis</a> is breaking out.</p><p>In the two decades in between it's&nbsp;been peachy, our lives following a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/eric-cantona\" title=\"\">Cantona</a>-<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldo\" title=\"\">Ronaldo</a>-shaped trajectory of blistering excitement and success: me, you, the Cockney Reds, those United-supporting rickshaw drivers in Kathmandu and restaurant owners in Nairobi. Clearly, the football fan's delusion can't bear close scrutiny. Yet the delusions are powerful. A recent film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3311384/\" title=\"\">Class of 92</a>, reunited the youth team that evolved behind Giggs, with the likes of David Beckham and Paul Scholes taking United to even dizzier heights. The DVD featured, astonishingly, contributions from Tony Blair, a diehard football fan in much the same way Sir Alex Ferguson is a diehard socialist. What was going on in that United youth team was, y'know, very much what was happening in New Labour – up and coming talent, ready to dominate at home and strut on the global stage. Barcelona, Baghdad. Good times.</p><p>And while Labour was in power, sowing the seeds of its own destruction (Blair didn't say), regulating the City with a light touch that would lead to financial crisis and obscene bankers' bonuses, Ferguson was acquiescing in the&nbsp;debt-laden <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/feb/11/comment.football\" title=\"\">takeover of the club</a> by&nbsp;Malcom Glazer's family.</p><p>Now both men have handed over to successors who – poisoned chalice or otherwise – turned their victories effortlessly into defeat. And a new order is in place. While the Glazers leech money from United, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi_United_Group\" title=\"\">Middle East petrodollars have thrust Manchester City skywards</a>. United fans must now identify with the new manager, David Moyes, and hope those cruelly captioned photos of him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/08/manchester-united-struggles-david-moyes-twitter-reaction\" title=\"\">doing the rounds online</a> (\"I don't know what I'm doing\") are not funny because they are true.</p><p>But the <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/listen-drunken-man-united-fan-3053682#.UuFhahY4mjI\" title=\"\">fan who rang 999 demanding to speak to Ferguson after seeing United crash out of the Capital One Cup</a> – a trophy that once would have caused few hearts to tremble in those parts – might not be the only one thinking emergency intervention is needed.</p><p>On a business level, United's stock is falling too, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae33ccc0-837d-11e3-aa65-00144feab7de.html#slide0\" title=\"\">its share price at new lows</a> and its financial clout today reported to be outside the top rank of European clubs for the first time. With a model built on selling the brand to commercial partners worldwide and TV income, slipping out of the top tier of European competition – as looks likely – threatens to hasten any decline.</p><p>As any non-United fan will rush to point out, this has been a club that has often spent its way to success – and now finds itself outspent. Ferguson's departure has been, as the Glazers foresaw in their own stock prospectus, the great commercial risk, the event that&nbsp;exposed the cracks.</p><p>That happy night in 1993 also recalls a time when United was barely a plc, a world less dominated by finance in football and beyond – and when being a United fan, even for those outside Manchester, didn't need justification. Pointing to the swelling ranks of other clubs' fans as arriviste gloryhunters may prove some consolation in trophyless years ahead.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GwynTopham\" title=\"\"><em>@GwynTopham</em></a></p>","headline":"Manchester United and my Moyes-life crisis","trailText":"<strong>Gwyn Topham:</strong> The Man United fan who rang 999 after humiliation at the hands of Sunderland is not the only one in despair","newspaperPageNumber":"30","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m623","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390506245470/David-Moyes-19-October-20-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390506245470/David-Moyes-19-October-20-006.jpg","wordcount":"661","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427880006","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8598567","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Gwyn Topham","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031780","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T20:26:16Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/23/manchester-united-moyes-fan-999-sunderland","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/23/manchester-united-moyes-fan-999-sunderland","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"football/manchester-united","webTitle":"Manchester United","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/manchester-united","references":[{"type":"pa-football-team","id":"pa-football-team/12"}]},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/football","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/football","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"football/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gwyntopham","webTitle":"Gwyn Topham","rcsId":"GNL004653","r2ContributorId":"15685","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/8/1268051831911/topham.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Gwyn Topham is the Guardian and Observer's transport correspondent.

Can Brighton's Green party lead the way?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T00:06:29Z","body":"<p>'I love bashing local government,\" Eric Pickles boasted to his fellow MPs as he slashed and kicked it round the back alleys of Westminster on Wednesday. They laughed. They all knew he had a wink and a nod from the boss, Don&nbsp;Cameroni. As he stood over his blood-stained victim, Pickles said their&nbsp;relationship remained <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/Pickles-I-bash-local-government-because-I-love-it/35456\" title=\"\">\"deep&nbsp;and&nbsp;loving\"</a>. To him, love is something out of The Sopranos.</p><p>We must now hurry down to Brighton. Next month the city's Green&nbsp;administration hopes to stage the&nbsp;first anti-Pickles backlash. The <a href=\"http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/RoyalPavilion/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Royal&nbsp;Pavilion</a> will echo to cries of freedom. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Steine\" title=\"\">The Steine</a> will echo the rage of Tahrir Square. The wheelchairs&nbsp;of Hove&nbsp;will charge with the scythes of Boudicca's chariots.</p><p>I carry no flag for the Green party. It is&nbsp;the Ukip of the left, pawn of the tycoons of Big Renewables. But it runs a minority administration in Brighton, and wants to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/16/green-councillors-brighton-referendum-council-tax-rise\" title=\"\">hold a ballot on a council tax rise of 4.75%</a>. The party campaigned last year against such a rise but its exotically named council leader, Jason Kitcat, says central cuts now make it vital. The money is to protect adult social care in a city with way above the national average of older people. He rightly wants a new mandate for the policy change, in accordance with the government's <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">2011 Localism Act</a>. The intention is utterly commendable.</p><p>Brighton has no virtue in this department. As a one-time resident I can attest that its government has long been awash in waste and union power. For Kitcat to cite \"the vulnerable old\" looks suspiciously like shroud-waving. Nor is the city a star in the localist firmament. It has long been in thrall to dreadful property profiteering. The <a href=\"http://www.visitbrighton.com/conferences\" title=\"\">most hideous conference centre in England</a> dominates the seafront. The glorious <a href=\"http://www.westpier.co.uk\" title=\"\">West Pier</a> has been left to rot into the sea, an eyesore inconceivable in any more self-respecting resort. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Marina\" title=\"\">monstrous marina</a> has defaced the majestic cliffs of Kemptown, wrecking the coast.</p><p>But revolution rarely has the luxury of choice. Local capping was invented by Margaret Thatcher, in her <a href=\"http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=105763\" title=\"\">first great swipe at local democracy in 1984</a>. Labour fought it when in opposition but continued it when that party came&nbsp;into power. The continuance was then cynically opposed by the Conservatives in turn. David Cameron declared that capping \"takes the power of decision about local spending and local taxation out of the hands of local voters and hands it to remote central bureaucracies\". Like many newcomers to power, he realised promises were a phenomenon of opposition. As soon as Cameron found himself controlling a \"remote central bureaucracy\" of his own, he discovered it to be a&nbsp;cosy custodian of fiscal virtue.</p><p>In a meagre attempt to honour his fallen pledge, Cameron proposed in his 2011 act that any council wanting to&nbsp;raise council tax by more than 2% above a centrally fixed level, currently a freeze, should be forced to hold a referendum. Spending below the cap required no such mandate. (Nor&nbsp;was there any suggestion that George Osborne's budget tax rises might also require mandating.)</p><p>Most councils have obeyed Cameron's&nbsp;policy, none raising its tax demand by more than the approved 2%. But the mere fact that many have come near to 2% has infuriated Pickles. He calls them \"democracy dodgers\", and immoral. He has told cabinet colleagues he wants to cut the threshold for a referendum to 1.5%. Ironically this has upset Theresa May, whose beloved police commissioners are also capped.</p><p>Close to bursting with rage, Pickles has won cash from the Treasury to bribe councils to obey his council tax freeze. Osborne is thus in effect raising taxes to bribe others not to raise them. If Brighton council declines to hold its referendum, Pickles has offered it £2.4m&nbsp;over two years, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Council_Tax&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"\">£70 off a band-D tax bill</a>. Money is being splurged by the centre simply so Pickles can boast that he has \"held down council tax\", which should be nothing to do with him. Welcome to the crazy world of coalition public finance.</p><p>Some councils have contrived to handle cuts in central grants, cuts which have taken 150,000 jobs out of local government in the past year alone. Tory Kensington and Chelsea's merging of some services with adjacent boroughs produced £43m a year in savings. This week they announced a celebratory £100 cut in <a href=\"http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/councilanddemocracy/counciltax.aspx\" title=\"\">council tax bills</a>, despite 25% less in central grant.</p><p>How much longer such bravura can go on is doubtful. Osborne's autumn statement shows UK tax revenue rising overall by 4.6% in 2014-15, and central income tax revenue by nearly 8%. Local&nbsp;council revenue is not just capped but the local tax base, property, is denied revaluation, leading to a perpetual real-terms decline. Since so much of central spending, on health, education and pensions, is ringfenced, the long-term squeeze on local councils is remorseless and intense. Councils are banned from doing what central government can do, which is relieve any pressure by raising taxes or borrowing. They are going to hell in a handcart.</p><p>How a Brighton referendum would turn out is entirely a matter for its voters. But a great public benefit would be served by holding one. Someone, somewhere, must stand up to the bullying, hectoring hypocrisy of Cameron's \"localism\" act and his henchman, Pickles, in full \"screw democracy\" mode. The queen of the south coast can at last redeem itself by writing a new chapter in the story of British government.</p>","headline":"Brighton's council tax revolution could strike a blow for democracy","trailText":"<strong>Simon Jenkins:</strong> Someone must stand up&nbsp;to the bullying of Eric Pickles and the 'localism' act.

At the same time their constitutions, as well as the manifestos of progressive political parties, pledge allegiance to a whole new variety of non- and post-human rights – rights of nature, declarations of inter-generational justice, and the recognition of Amerindian cultures.</p><p>These cultures are being celebrated in <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar.aspx?ex=26\" title=\"\">Beyond El Dorado, an exhibition at the British Museum</a> in London. It includes hundreds of gold objects excavated in the early 20th century; and ceramics and stone necklaces from the Museo del Oro in Bogotá – which has one of the best collections of pre-Hispanic gold in the world – and the British Museum's unique collections.</p><p>The British public has responded en masse to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/14/british-museum-beyond-el-dorado-review\" title=\"\">profound spiritual and aesthetic message expressed by the gold objects</a> displayed in the museum. But now it is time to consider the ethical and political implications of that message: not as a relic of the distant past, but because it may contain some of the answers we desperately seek to the most relevant questions of our time. A <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar/event_detail.aspx?eventId=1455&amp;title=Colombia%27s%20resources:%20blessing%20or%20curse?&amp;eventType=Lecture\" title=\"\">discussion organised by the Guardian and the British Museum next month</a> aims to do just that with the help of a distinguished panel.</p><p>These big questions – climate change, food security, equality – are already being discussed in Latin America thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/chile-student-protest-election-camila-vallejo\" title=\"\">social movements that are helping to remould politics</a> and political discourse. In these countries both the electoral survival of progressive parties and the continuity of crucial processes of reconciliation and democratisation depend on the support of increasingly active social movements. These often include rural as well as urban campaigners, concerned about the social and environmental devastation caused by global market forces.</p><p>In this respect, social movements in the Americas display an attitude that cannot be dismissed simply as backwards or anti-business. They demonstrate a legitimate critical attitude towards the contradictions inherent in processes of globalisation. And rather than withdrawing into some fantasy zone, these movements seek to engage actively with the state and transform the relationship between the state and the people from within.</p><p>The concept that explains this interdependence between social movements and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/10/hugo-chavez-hector-abad-latin-america-left\" title=\"\">progressive parties in government</a> goes by the name of \"<a href=\"http://monthlyreview.org/2007/09/01/dual-power-in-the-venezuelan-revolution\" title=\"\">dual power</a>\": the underpinning of vertical state-citizen relations by horizontal social movements, ready to criticise the decisions of the parties they elect on the basis of a commitment to a progressive agenda. This is how the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/19/weekly-year-review-2013-latin-america\" title=\"\">protests that rocked the politics of countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia</a> last year must be understood: as manifestations of dual power, and expressions of the terms of a new social contract – one that includes nature not only as a reservoir of resources but as an agent of politics and of the wellbeing of society.</p><p>As far as these movements are concerned, democracy and ethical politics go hand in hand. They discuss the big questions of our time – climate change, food security, the role of commons, the rights of nature, equality – in a political arena that until recently appeared to offer no alternative to the \"one size fits all\" view of globalisation and the market.</p><p>Crucially, in most Latin American countries such dogmatic views were imposed by sheer force, either military – as in Chile, Brazil, Argentina or Bolivia –or paramilitary, as in Colombia. To most Colombians it is now clear – a matter of indisputable record – that the paramilitary violence that engulfed the country with peculiar intensity during the last decade and a half, with the leading intervention of the United States, was part and parcel of an economic project rather than solely a counter-insurgency exercise.</p><p>The model still in place depends on the unbridled extraction of natural resources from parts of the country that have traditionally sustained peasant, indigenous and Afro-Colombian ways of life, and is the result of such violence. Because of this, as far as the social movements are concerned, any peace process worthy of the name must also consider the serious ethical questions posited by climate change science, food security and so on.</p><p>According to the information provided by climate science, as well as from anthropology and the humanities, it is no longer possible to keep human history separate from the history of the planet. We have become geological agents, capable of affecting and even destroying nature as a whole. We do this through the very processes that we considered to be at the heart of freedom in the 20th century – chief among them free trade. What we need now is a new politics, not only a politics of freedom, but one of post-human rights and cosmopolitics.</p><p>• A panel discussion – Colombia's resources: blessing or curse? – <a

The same way we resolve similar disputes in courts throughout the United States –&nbsp;with a public trial by an impartial jury.&nbsp;Unfortunately, criminal trials are not well&nbsp;suited to decide when the government has overstepped its bounds.&nbsp;</p><p>If Snowden were arrested today, extradited to the United States, and brought to trial, the rules of evidence would prevent him from arguing that his actions were necessary to reveal governmental wrongdoing. Nor would the jury hear about the legal challenges to the programs he has disclosed.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, the judge would instruct the jury that neither Snowden’s good intentions nor the fact that he may have revealed illegal activities are a defense to the charges against him.&nbsp;If this were a normal case, the jury would be asked to answer one question, and only one question: based on the evidence, did Snowden steal government secrets and intentionally disclose them? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video\">According to Snowden’s own statements</a>, that answer is clear.&nbsp;But this is not a normal case.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, a federal judge ruled that a program Snowden disclosed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/16/nsa-phone-surveillance-likely-unconstitutional-judge\">violates the constitution</a> and must end. An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/16/edward-snowden-ruling-nsa-surveillance\">internal document Snowden leaked</a> from the NSA’s oversight division acknowledged that the agency flouted court rules and legal authorities on thousands of occasions.&nbsp;</p><p>And Snowden’s disclosures have forced James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, to admit that he previously &nbsp;provided “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/james-clapper-senate-erroneous\">clearly erroneous</a>” testimony to Congress about the NSA’s activities.&nbsp;As a result, Snowden’s defenders argue that putting him on trial for revealing classified information ignores the bigger picture –&nbsp;that his <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/daniel-ellsberg-nsa-leaker-snowden-made-the-right-call/2013/07/07/0b46d96c-e5b7-11e2-aef3-339619eab080_story.html\">actions were necessary</a> to expose egregious government misconduct.&nbsp;</p><p>But Snowden’s trial need not be typical. The Department of Justice and Snowden’s attorneys could agree to conduct it by a slightly different set of rules, rules that would permit the jury to consider the full extent of the alleged governmental wrongdoing he uncovered along with the full scope of his alleged crimes.&nbsp;For example, perhaps as part of an agreement for Snowden to return to stand trial, federal prosecutors could allow him to present evidence about the legality of the programs he disclosed and, ultimately, argue that his actions were justified by the alleged wrongdoing he revealed.&nbsp;</p><p>For its part, the government could present evidence of the harm allegedly caused by Snowden’s actions. Then, at the close of trial, the jury could consider whether, on balance, the classified information Snowden disclosed was important enough&nbsp;to the&nbsp;public interest that he should not go to jail for revealing it.&nbsp;These rules would be a departure from the standard practice in federal court. But a judge is likely to allow these procedures if the government and Snowden agree.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, by taking this approach, the government could place the difficult question of what to do about Snowden in the hands of the jury, which is exactly where it belongs.&nbsp;Throughout the United States, groups of 12 men and women, drawn from a cross-section of their communities, sit in courtrooms to consider evidence and render a verdict that represents the collective judgment of the people.&nbsp;</p><p>In this manner, ordinary American citizens stand between a defendant and the formidable power of our government.&nbsp;This system is no accident; the founders believed a jury trial was an essential bulwark against tyranny.&nbsp;Here, in a case that involves allegations of conduct that could be described as tyrannical, the jury should have its say. And the defenders of the NSA, who argue that Snowden’s actions constituted the highest form of treason, should stand up in open court and make their case.&nbsp;Then, with all the facts before them, we should let the jury decide.</p>","headline":"Edward Snowden can get a fair trial in the US.

Now it seems we are experiencing the demise of what some medical professionals have identified as a social sickness that has ravaged great swaths of society over the last decade.</p><p>According to a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/22/facebook-princeton-researchers-infectious-disease\" title=\"\">Princeton study that likens Facebook to an infectious disease</a>, the platform will lose 80% of its users by 2017. It's estimated that soon the only signs of life left on Facebook will be toothpaste brands wondering why nobody likes them, and <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/455423/Nick-Clegg-beats-David-Cameron-Ed-Miliband-and-Nigel-Farage-for-Facebook-likes\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a>.</p><p>There has been <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/01/22/princeton-facebook-study/\" title=\"\">some scepticism</a> about the application of disease dynamics on to a social network. The Princeton researchers make their case via epidemiological modelling, acronyms, and lots of formulae where the γI terms in equations 1b and 1c are multiplied by R/N to give equations 3b and 3c. Quite frankly, this means the sum total of F/U+C*K all to me. Nevertheless, I don't think it is a stretch to compare Facebook to a disease, as this highly scientific medical reference guide demonstrates:</p><h2>Facebook fever</h2><p><em>Causes:</em> An enthusiastic recommendation from an infected peer is the predominant cause of sickness. A virulent species of <em>Harvardus aluminus</em> (H.), parasites generating from Massachusetts, were the initial cause of the virus spreading, however the disease now has many carriers. The best course of action is to suspect that everyone may be a potential carrier, even your mother.</p><p>Initial warning signs: The first indication of infection is signing up to Facebook. OK, you think, I will happily hand over all my personal data to this well-designed website, because it will facilitate my ability to share seamlessly with social connections. This is a perfectly healthy thing to do and may not lead to further complications. However, a large proportion of users then go on to develop more serious problems.</p><p><em>Common symptoms:</em> A tendency to spontaneously overshare; an inability to believe you are in a meaningful relationship until you are \"Facebook official\"; waking up frequently throughout the night to check how many \"likes\" your status update has had and self-loathing when you find that the only one is from your annoying friend Emma, who you can't remember how you know anyway; the breakdown of your meaningful relationship after you find their ex is still tagging them in pictures; a compulsion to Facebook-stalk your ex that sends you down a \"research\" wormhole from which you emerge bewildered, confused, and a little bit ashamed.</p><p><em>Variation in symptoms:</em> Those most afflicted by Facebook fever can be classed into a small but statistically significant subset commonly described as \"social media experts\" (SMEs). These are grown adults whose job it is to tell other grown adults how to use Facebook to sell things and influence people. SMEs will often experience delusions of grandeur and refer to themselves in terms such as \"social media ninja\" or \"digital prophet\". Avoid these people at all costs so as to not worsen in condition.</p><p><em>Cure:</em> According to the Princeton study, Facebook fever resolves organically over time as we gradually become immune to its attractions. The authors claim that: \"Ideas are spread through communicative contact between different people who share ideas with each other. Idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea, which can be thought of as the gain of 'immunity' to the idea.\" Which is a very long way of saying: \"Facebook got boring and uncool.\" Thanks, science.</p><p>NB: all symptoms cited come from external observation and have nothing to do with me whatsoever.</p>","headline":"If Facebook is an infectious disease, here's a guide to the symptoms","trailText":"<strong>Arwa Mahdawi:</strong> A Princeton study uses epidemiological modelling to predict the social network's decline.

That's happened to a certain extent, but I can't ignore the ongoing violence in America's schools. On 14 January, a 12-year-old boy in New Mexico<a href=\"http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-78892059/\"> came to school with a sawed-off, 20-gauge shotgun </a>and opened fire, wounding two students before a teacher was able to persuade him to put the gun down. On 17 January, two high school students were injured at a charter school in Philadelphia <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teen-philly-high-school-shooting-charged-adult-article-1.1585712\">when another teen opened fire</a>. On 20 January, a student sitting in the parking lot of Widener University in Chester, Pennsylvania<a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/21/22382802-pa-college-student-shot-gunman-still-at-large?lite\"> was injured by an unknown gunman</a>.

While the damage done at these schools was far less than that done at Sandy Hook – where 20 children and six staff members were killed – the lack of attention paid to these events is indicative of a larger issue: Americans are becoming numb to gun violence.</p><p>For teachers, however, these tragedies are all too real. With so many of these shootings – many of them the worst the nation has seen – taking place at schools and universities, we educators can't help but feel afraid. Though all of the teachers I've spoken with, myself included, have said they feel safe at their own schools, we don't have the luxury of tuning the media out. Our students naturally have questions about the shootings that hit the news, and it is our job to answer them and combat any insecurities that might arise from these issues. </p><p>Schools now <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/us/in-age-of-school-shootings-lockdown-drills-are-the-new-duck-and-cover.html?_r=0\">practice lockdown drills</a> to prepare students for what to do if a shooter does enter the building. These drills entail getting all students out of the hallways, turning off the lights, locking doors, and having students sit silently on the floor and away from the windows. These drills are practiced multiple times a year, so these issues are constantly on students' and teachers' minds. It's downright depressing every time a shooter takes away the safety our students should be able to feel at school. For many, school was the last safe place left, and now they don't even have that. </p><p>The other tragedy is that these issues aren't new. In September, President Obama <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/22736642-452/obama-fears-us-growing-numb-to-gun-violence.html\">began to fear the nation's immunity to mass violence</a>. The incidents this month are part of what he called a \"backdrop of daily tragedies\"; just part of the fabric of American culture. </p><p>We are frustrated as a nation. There are concrete actions we could take to better protect our classrooms, but we're stalling. After the shooting at Sandy Hook, President Obama promised the nation stricter gun laws, mandatory background checks before gun purchases, and more ways to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. However, two thirds of the gun laws states passed since December 2012 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html?-r=0\">have actually loosened regulations</a>. And legislation at the national level completely halted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/18/pro-gun-groups-donated-senators\">after the Senate voted down Obama's proposals</a>. </p><p>Frankly, the national debate about gun control is becoming \"<a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-29/news/ct-oped-page-20130929_1_gun-debate-mass-shooting-mass-violence\">mind-numbing</a>\", as New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu put it. The NRA is running ad campaigns denouncing gun control laws as fast as Democrats can introduce any legislation. The debate is loud and sounds divisive. In reality, the majority of Americans – <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/162083/americans-wanted-gun-background-checks-pass-senate.aspx\">65% according to an April 2013 Gallup poll</a> – favor background checks for gun purchases, a measure the Senate did not pass. </p><p>It is estimated that there are about <a href=\"http://www.heedinggodscall.org/content/pfctoolkit-10\">30,000 gun-related deaths each year</a> in America. With all of this violence and all of the seemingly futile debate surrounding it, it's no wonder Americans tune it out. It's common enough to feel mundane and frustrating enough to cause more than a few grey hairs.</p><p>My teaching colleagues and I crave action. We want stricter gun laws to keep guns out of the hands of the bad guys. We <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/23/keep-guns-out-of-classrooms\">don't want to carry guns</a> or see our students and visitors to our schools subjected to daily metal detecting; we want guns to stay out of the hands of people who will use them maliciously in the first place. We want the Senate to do what the majority of their constituents want and pass comprehensive gun control laws rather than bickering and stalling on this important issue.</p><p>Experts expect President Obama to again<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2014/01/if-history-repreats-obamas-state-of-the-union-wont-compel-congress-to-act.html\"> call for gun control laws</a> in his state of the union address on Tuesday. My fellow teachers are demanding more this year; parents across this nation should be, too. So should all Americans. Background checks for gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons are common sense reforms. They are the least we should be doing to our schools, and our nation, safe.</p>","headline":"Americans are becoming numb to gun violence.

Should a child be just a few minutes tardy and miss registration 10 times in a term, his or her parents will be fined £60. Per child. \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadya_Suleman\" title=\"\">Octomom</a>\" must be hoping the policy doesn't go stateside.</p><p>A spokesperson for the school notes: \"The link between good attendance and pupils achieving well at school is clear.\"</p><p>It's somewhat disconcerting that a person responsible for educating our children does not understand the difference between correlation and causation: kids from stable homes get to school on time and they do well when they get there. More than this, though, the evidence for such a proposal is weak.</p><p>Political philosopher Michael Sandel provides a pertinent example in his book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/17/what-money-cant-buy-michael-sandel-review\" title=\"\">What Money Can't Buy</a>.</p><p>A daycare in Israel had a similar problem: parents were arriving late to collect their children. In response, the daycare fined those who didn't pick their tots up on time. Except this did not result in increased punctuality; quite the opposite. Parents were more likely to be late after the fines were introduced. They simply paid the fee and thought no more about it. The intrinsic motivation – to conform to the social norm of being on time – was crowded out by the extrinsic motivation of cash fines.</p><p>Similarly, researchers at Stanford University carried out a <a href=\"http://fitaba.com/page16/assets/Overjustification%20Study%20-%20Lepper.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a> in which children were asked to draw pictures. Some of the children were told upfront that they would be rewarded with a \"good player award\" with a red ribbon and a shiny gold star. But the results were surprising. These children spent about 9% of their free time on the drawing activity, compared with 17% for those not enticed by an award.</p><p>The extrinsic motivation replaced the intrinsic one, which would have been a much stronger driver. For example, <a href=\"http://intl-rop.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/10/19/0734371X11421495\" title=\"\">employee engagement</a> is three times more strongly related to intrinsic than extrinsic motivation, and the former is a stronger predictor than the latter of <a href=\"http://www.langleygroup.com.au/images/Deci---2005---Self-determination-theory-and-work-motivation-.pdf\" title=\"\">job performance</a>.</p><p>Added to this, while I hope my boss isn't reading this, there is <a href=\"http://www.timothy-judge.com/Judge,%20Piccolo,%20Podsakoff,%20et%20al.%20(JVB%202010).pdf\" title=\"\">evidence</a> that job performance and satisfaction are only weakly related to pay. This phenomenon has been repeatedly supported. A <a href=\"http://www.rug.nl/gmw/psychology/research/onderzoek_summerschool/firststep/content/papers/4.4.pdf\" title=\"\">comprehensive review</a> of the literature showed that extrinsic motivators (from marshmallows to money) consistently reduce intrinsic motivation. When external outcomes are concrete and predictable, intrinsic motivation reduces by about a third.</p><p>So, Emerson Valley school will likely see the same results as the Israeli daycare centre. These fines – part of a borough-wide initiative but at the discretion of individual schools – may well make kids later in the morning. Surely the council can think of better ways to – dare I say it – nudge parents?</p><p>The government knows full well that financial disincentives don't really influence behaviour. In fact, it's a great earner for them. About 60% of the money we pay for petrol goes to tax; a 10% price increase would only decrease traffic by 1% over a year.</p><p>The fact is, we are cognitive misers and rarely weigh up the costs and benefits of a decision.</p><p>Could it be that, like duty on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol, this is partly a money-making exercise for the school? In fact, these fines might even encourage parents to be tardy, by implying that it's what everyone else is doing. An <a href=\"http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Cialdini2003.pdf\" title=\"\">experiment by Robert Cialdini</a> found that 14% of people dropped rubbish in a clean environment, while 32% did so in a littered environment.</p><p>Instead, the school might want to use social proof for good by modelling HMRC's letters and telling parents something like \"85% of parents at the school bring their children in on time\".</p><p>Maybe this is an example of where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/02/nudge-unit-has-it-worked\" title=\"\">Dave's Nudge Unit</a> could be put to better use.</p>","headline":"Why fining the parents of unpunctual pupils doesn't work","trailText":"<strong>Patrick Fagan:</strong> If schools want to make sure children arrive at the school gates on time, they need to focus on the intrinsic motivation of parents","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5m6","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390491490725/Children-arriving-at-scho-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390491490725/Children-arriving-at-scho-006.jpg","wordcount":"641","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427859165","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8597572","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Fagan","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031594","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T15:57:52Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/23/fining-parents-unpunctual-school-pupils","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/23/fining-parents-unpunctual-school-pupils","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/schools","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/education/schools","references":[]},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education","type":"keyword","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/education","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/education/education","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-fagan","webTitle":"Patrick Fagan","r2ContributorId":"60194","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387488547638/Patrick-Fagan.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Fagan is an associate lecturer in consumer behaviour at Goldsmiths University.

The flaw the high-schooler discovered is commonly known as a MySQL error, and it is ridiculously simple to fix. With teenage curiosity at play, Joshua Rogers managed to access the government server, using a process known as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\">SQL injection</a>.</p><p>Due to the PTV’s security oversight, databases of personal information of over 600,000 users –&nbsp;including full names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and nine digits of their credit cards –&nbsp;were accessible online. And if the young wunderkind&nbsp;could access those databases, it meant that&nbsp;far more nefarious and potentially criminal types could&nbsp;illicitly access&nbsp;the databases as well.</p><p>Legally, Joshua wasn’t required to inform PTV,&nbsp;but ethically he thought it was the right thing to do. So he kindly emailed PTV’s staff on 26 December&nbsp;to inform them of the flaw in their security.</p><p>PTV’s response was less than adequate.&nbsp;Not a well-deserved “thank you”&nbsp;(although PTV did acknowledge Joshua’s initial email after a journalist came asking some pointy questions about the data breach), and not even a courtesy email to PTV customers to let them know their personal information had been breached and was potentially at risk of being fraudulently used. No, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/security-it/hacked-site-reports-boy-to-police-20140108-hv7tl.html\">a statement PTV made to The Age</a>, they \"referred the matter to Victoria Police.\"</p><p>Victoria Police&nbsp;declined to comment on whether&nbsp;their investigation will specifically&nbsp;involve an examination of Joshua's&nbsp;amateur pen testing of PTV’s network.&nbsp;In a statement made to The Guardian, they&nbsp;stated that they’d \"received a report from Public Transport Victoria relating to the unauthorised access to their network. As the matter is currently under investigation, we are not in a position to comment.\"&nbsp;</p><p>How is it that&nbsp;PTV’s potentially disastrous lack of basic online security cops nothing more than a well-deserved swipe from tech journos rather than a hefty fine for failing to notify customers, while a&nbsp;young&nbsp;infosec enthusiast doing the right thing&nbsp;may face an&nbsp;investigation?</p><p>While&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-reports/oaic-community-attitudes-to-privacy-survey-research-report-2013%23_Toc368300741\">96% of Australians want mandatory data breach notification laws</a>, Australian companies aren’t currently&nbsp;legally required to disclose data breaches to customers, even when people’s personal details are potentially compromised.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aph.gov.au%2FParliamentary_Business%2FBills_Legislation%2FBills_Search_Results%2FResult%3FbId%3Dr5059&amp;ei=rLnhUsTgDI6ykgWxvIHABg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_RRKc5LnIsSfWlbjUU3rsZUHKcg&amp;sig2=6V5KDSbsYfX6dlkNYmv4Tw&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2013</a> lapsed in November after the federal election, despite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.efa.org.au/2013/10/11/mandatory-data-breach-notification-legislation/\">support</a>&nbsp;from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Australian Privacy Commissioner and public interest groups including Electronic&nbsp;Frontiers&nbsp;Australia and the Australian Privacy Foundation. Despite&nbsp;this show of hand,&nbsp;Coalition senators Gary Humphries and Sue Boyce raised&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mumbrella.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Senate-report-on-Privacy-Act.pdf\">objections to the bill</a>, claiming that&nbsp;“&nbsp;stakeholders should be better scrutinised, understood and acted upon by the relevant government agencies as this new privacy regime is rolled out.”</p><p>Those stakeholders, who kicked and screeched in horror at the legislation attempts to increase accountability and implement fines for failures to protect and notify customers of data breaches, included data-miners whose bread and butter has always been paid by sucking up personal information online, as well as telephone&nbsp;companies&nbsp;the previous government attorney-general Mark Dreyfus essentially&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/05/sony-vodafone-and-telstra-called-out-as-attorney-general-unveils-data-breach-laws/\">took a stick to</a>&nbsp;over prior data breaches.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a problematic imbalance in the evolution of Australian policy and practice in response to data breaches: individuals who report critical security flaws face potential legal action, while corporations who fail to fix and report data breaches to paying customers go unpunished.</p><p>Threatening to call the police on people who report security flaws has a chilling effect against encouraging good citizenship. Reporting a dangerous hole in a public road isn’t illegal, and similarly we shouldn’t threaten&nbsp;people who point out potential holes in infosec, particularly when breaches put sensitive information at risk.</p><p>Today, a simple Google search for '“inurl:.gov.au \"this document is confidential”' raises approximately thousands of&nbsp;responses on Australian government websites with potentially confidential documents. In light of heavy-handed responses to innocent individuals who report security issues, who would be game to open the links to check and see if the documents are legitimately available to the public, or unwittingly released online?&nbsp;Who would be foolhardy enough to report critical breaches of confidentially, when pointing out security failures potentially garners the reward of a knock on the door from the police?</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b06cbfe8-545e-4727-843a-dd1904e73be3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390523862433/a7a2ff1f-d621-4e32-9bff-1f13a6ed6172-460x276.png\" alt=\"inurl:.gov.au \"this document is confidential\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A search for \"inurl:.gov.au \"this document is confidential\".</figcaption> </figure> <p>It is vital that an amnesty is implemented against prosecution of individuals who report security flaws.

democracy.&nbsp;It’s our good fortune as a nation to be blessed with abundant natural resources that are our common wealth. Our fertile land, clean air and water underpin our country’s agricultural heritage, which has fed and clothed us.</p><p>Australia’s native wildlife is unique, and the bush where Australians walk, fish, hunt and camp is habitat for the animals that are emblems of the country itself. Traditional owners of the country have the longest continuing culture in the world, and a connection to the bush that goes back tens of thousands of years.</p><p>And then there’s the Australian character: tough, wry, tending to side with the underdog and not afraid of a fight to defend what matters to us. &nbsp;</p><p>In the battle that is gripping my community this coming&nbsp;Australia Day, my fifth generation farming family and I are siding with the underdogs against Big Coal.

Greg Hunt has the power to revoke Whitehaven’s approval and end the conflict that is dividing our community.&nbsp;We see it as our duty to protect our irreplaceable natural assets, our land and future

A recent study called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.norc.org%2FPDFs%2FBeliefs_about_God_Report.pdf&amp;ei=ZHFcUO3nL8q2hQfE6YG4Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE45L4Kh9PuYZgSlGVukKPINO6GWQ&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Beliefs About God Across Time and Countries</a> found that 52.1% of people asked whether they believed in God identified themselves as atheists. This compared with only 10.3% in western Germany. Indeed, the survey was unable to find a single person under the age of 28 in eastern Germany who believed in God. Obviously there are some – I think I may have even met some once – but the survey was unable to find them. On the face of it this is an extraordinary finding and it is something that needs some careful explanation.</p><p>Different reasons are adduced for the absence of religion in the east. The first one that is usually brought out is the fact that that area was run by the Communist party from 1945 to 1990 and that its explicit hostility to religion meant that it was largely stamped out. However, this is not entirely the case. In fact, after initial hostilities in the first years of the GDR, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany\" title=\"\">SED</a> came to a relatively comfortable accommodation with what was called the Church in Socialism. The churches in the GDR were given a high degree of autonomy by SED standards and indeed became the organisational focus of the dissident movement of the 1990s, which was to some extent led by Protestant pastors.</p><p>In addition to an accommodation with religion, the party also deliberately created alternative poles of integration for the population. Young people were brought up in a highly ideological atmosphere and were required to undergo a so-called <em>Jugendweihe</em> – a sort of atheist confirmation. Interestingly, this ceremony has survived the end of communism and many young people still voluntarily enter into it. Equally, especially under Eric Honecker in the 1970s and 80s, an attempt was made to create a sort of \"GDR patriotism\", in which figures from Prussian history such as Frederick the Great were put back on their plinths in East Berlin and integrated into the Communist narrative of the forward march of history. Martin Luther, Thomas Münzer and other figures from the Reformation were also recruited into the party.</p><p>Another factor is that religion in eastern Germany is also overwhelmingly Protestant, both historically and in contemporary terms. Of the 25% who do identify themselves as religious, 21% of them are Protestants. The other 4% is made up of a small number of Catholics as well as Muslims and adherents of other new evangelical groups, new-age sects or alternative religions. The Protestant church is in steep decline with twice as many people leaving it every year as joining.</p><p>If we were to follow the Weberian line on this, then a highly Protestant area undergoing rapid modernisation would almost automatically experience a process of radical secularisation going hand-in-hand with industrialisation, a process which was only speeded up by the communist obsession with heavy industry.</p><p>When we look at western Germany however, we see that there Catholics are in a majority and indeed, political power in West Germany has traditionally been built on western-orientated Catholic support for the Christian Democratic Union in the south and west. Indeed, the first chancellor of postwar West Germany, Konrad Adenauer, had been mayor of Cologne in the 1930s and even then was in favour of the division of Germany and a \"Rhineland Alliance\" as a sort of precursor of the European Union.</p><p>What all of this means is that rather than simply just being an area that was occupied by the Soviet Union and their satraps in the East German Communist party, the eastern part of Germany has an identity which – almost a quarter of a century on – continues to make unification more difficult than expected. Religious confession, or rather the lack of it, plays an important role in this. This has led some to talk of East German atheism as a form of continuing political and regional identification. For example, in 2000 the Catholic theologian Eberhard Tiefensee identified what he called an \"East German folk atheism\" which could be argued to constitute a substantial part of a regional identity against West German Catholic domination.</p><p>Secularisation processes are under way throughout the continent and the role of religion and the church in modernity are being questioned everywhere, from gay marriage to women priests to abortion and on to whether the EU should identify itself as a Christian entity. The question should perhaps be whether it is actually folk atheism that represents the future of Europe.</p>","headline":"Eastern Germany: the most godless place on

In partnership with IndigenousX, we're inviting its weekly host to tell us about who they are, what issues they're passionate about, and what they have in store for us during their upcoming week. &nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Tell us about yourself. Who are you, where are you from, what do you do?</b></h2><p>I am a Yuwallarai woman from northwest NSW. I’m 46 years old, a daughter, a sister, an aunty and – Aboriginal way – a mother and grandmother. I currently spend my time between Sydney and Lismore in NSW, but \"home\" is Goodooga in the northwest of the state, where many of my family members live.&nbsp;</p><p>I was raised in a safe and loving environment by my Aboriginal mum (herself the oldest of 18 children) and non-Aboriginal dad, both of whom always told me, my sister and two brothers that we could be and do anything we wanted.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;\">A generation ago, many of my family were stationhands, shearers, jackaroos and jillaroos, and domestic servants. Today, we have a teacher, a writer, community and youth workers, a police officer, a surveyor amongst our number.&nbsp;</span></p><p>For the past 25 years, I have worked in print and radio journalism, communications, and management of Indigenous organisations.&nbsp;In July this year,&nbsp;I&nbsp;was elected co-chair of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnationalcongress.com.au%2F&amp;ei=W5ThUuG3KsXCkgXKnYDYBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuANaAgC8UaAlB7U0ArMCQ-xVPsw&amp;sig2=VUFA7VsaX1i2Jx9kEYXWwQ&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples</a>, a national representative voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I’m also a director of <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reconciliation.org.au%2F&amp;ei=bZThUv29JYH1lAX30YHQDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGslpBWb6z0-Z4uYAjyZQPKhnA8eg&amp;sig2=yESCvF53EODOUtfy3JsWmQ&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Reconciliation Australia</a> and a member of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deadlys.com.au%2Fvote%2Fcriteria-nominating-and-voting-in-the-deadlys%2F&amp;ei=fpThUpL3INGlkgW7noDoAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWIPC-QSB5iFCeoOqrLgPfplArgg&amp;sig2=v0hKQHPbzzf-9VQCQo__eA&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Deadly Awards Executive Academy</a>.</p><h2><b>What do you plan to talk about on @IndigenousX this week?</b></h2><p>I’m privileged to meet and know many people who strive towards a robust, fair and just Australia. I want to highlight ideas and the work we can all do to address and meet that challenge. This week encompasses&nbsp;26 January, a day when I personally celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ survival, and a day I believe presents an opportunity for all Australians to acknowledge the nation’s historical truths and collectively dream about a better shared future.&nbsp;</p><p>It’ll also be a big week for the Congress, with some public meetings around the country serving as vital rallying points to assure our members and supporters that Congress will survive even if the federal government follows through on plans not to honour a previous budget funding commitment covering the next three years. Congress is owned and operated by&nbsp;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander&nbsp;Peoples. As such, our future is in our own hands. Now, more than ever, we need to build a national unity movement.</p><h2><b>What issue(s) affecting Indigenous peoples do you think is most pressing?</b></h2><p>Achieving justice and respect – in every realm – for our inherent rights as First Peoples. I’m especially passionate about keeping families together and on country; keeping our stories and identity strong; combatting racism; addressing the over-incarceration of our peoples; and ensuring through education and capacity building that we’re in the best possible shape physically, mentally, spiritually and economically to meet the challenges ahead.</p><h2><b>Who are your role models and why?</b></h2><p>There are so many, from our early warriors and resistance fighters to the likes of Aboriginal rights activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAnthony_Fernando&amp;ei=5ZThUt-mHoLilAXRv4CgCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4o-tXLj0KbTY5l1r-DeqknJxH-Q&amp;sig2=wRQSGLuFpbcJptlX9lMBbg&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.dGI\">Anthony Martin Fernando,</a><b>&nbsp;</b>American civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks, the <a href=\"http://indigenousrights.net.au/section.asp?sID=33\">1965 Freedom Riders</a>, everyone who helped to establish the first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled organisations, the late <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Mabo\">Eddie Mabo,</a> and my own mum the late Pam Parker (née Lamb), who went to school for little more than a year but educated herself enough to run two businesses and go to university.&nbsp;</p><p>I am inspired by all good, honest, dignified and courageous women and men who won’t wait for others to do what’s right, and who will put self-interest aside and act for the most vulnerable in society. As well as the big issues, I also advocate small but mighty acts of kindness, like asking someone who seems sad, worried or frightened \"are you okay?\" and listening genuinely to their answer (sometimes people just need someone to hear them). Or, if you see someone copping abuse on a train, moving to sit or stand beside them – silently if that’s all you’re comfortable with – so they know they’re not alone. Often the people who are most generous are those with the least to give.</p><h2><b>What are your hopes for the future?</b></h2><p>I hope for vibrant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and families that are valued and secure, where we celebrate success and diversity in every sphere of life, learn from mistakes, and believe in ourselves. We’re often told – by ourselves and others – that we must choose one way or the other but I believe that we should be able to avail ourselves of every possible and principled means to make our lives better and build stronger, respectful relationships. I dream of a future where our children’s horizons are endless.</p>","headline":"Q&A with  Kirstie Parker: on acts of kindness and Indigenous survival","trailText":"<b>IndigenousX:</b>&nbsp;Each week, a new guest hosts the @IndigenousX Twitter account.

protest movements is shaking up the old economic order","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-01-24T10:32:11Z","body":"<p>In Latin America, as elsewhere, progressive governments of the centre and left struggle with a seemingly intractable dilemma: should the country exploit its natural resources to the fullest, no matter what the consequences – or consider ethical questions such as the wellbeing of the natural environment and future generations?</p><p>Countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil hope to benefit from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/06/global-economy-economics\" title=\"\">commodity boom</a> in global markets, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/18/china-brazil-south-america-trade\" title=\"\">fuelled by demand in China</a> and elsewhere. At the same time their constitutions, as well as the manifestos of progressive political parties, pledge allegiance to a whole new variety of non- and post-human rights – rights of nature, declarations of inter-generational justice, and the recognition of Amerindian cultures.</p><p>These cultures are being celebrated in <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar.aspx?ex=26\" title=\"\">Beyond El Dorado, an exhibition at the British Museum</a> in London. It includes hundreds of gold objects excavated in the early 20th century; and ceramics and stone necklaces from the Museo del Oro in Bogotá – which has one of the best collections of pre-Hispanic gold in the world – and the British Museum's unique collections.</p><p>The British public has responded en masse to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/14/british-museum-beyond-el-dorado-review\" title=\"\">profound spiritual and aesthetic message expressed by the gold objects</a> displayed in the museum. But now it is time to consider the ethical and political implications of that message: not as a relic of the distant past, but because it may contain some of the answers we desperately seek to the most relevant questions of our time. A <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar/event_detail.aspx?eventId=1455&amp;title=Colombia%27s%20resources:%20blessing%20or%20curse?&amp;eventType=Lecture\" title=\"\">discussion organised by the Guardian and the British Museum next month</a> aims to do just that with the help of a distinguished panel.</p><p>These big questions – climate change, food security, equality – are already being discussed in Latin America thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/chile-student-protest-election-camila-vallejo\" title=\"\">social movements that are helping to remould politics</a> and political discourse. In these countries both the electoral survival of progressive parties and the continuity of crucial processes of reconciliation and democratisation depend on the support of increasingly active social movements. These often include rural as well as urban campaigners, concerned about the social and environmental devastation caused by global market forces.</p><p>In this respect, social movements in the Americas display an attitude that cannot be dismissed simply as backwards or anti-business. They demonstrate a legitimate critical attitude towards the contradictions inherent in processes of globalisation. And rather than withdrawing into some fantasy zone, these movements seek to engage actively with the state and transform the relationship between the state and the people from within.</p><p>The concept that explains this interdependence between social movements and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/10/hugo-chavez-hector-abad-latin-america-left\" title=\"\">progressive parties in government</a> goes by the name of \"<a href=\"http://monthlyreview.org/2007/09/01/dual-power-in-the-venezuelan-revolution\" title=\"\">dual power</a>\": the underpinning of vertical state-citizen relations by horizontal social movements, ready to criticise the decisions of the parties they elect on the basis of a commitment to a progressive agenda. This is how the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/19/weekly-year-review-2013-latin-america\" title=\"\">protests that rocked the politics of countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia</a> last year must be understood: as manifestations of dual power, and expressions of the terms of a new social contract – one that includes nature not only as a reservoir of resources but as an agent of politics and of the wellbeing of society.</p><p>As far as these movements are concerned, democracy and ethical politics go hand in hand. They discuss the big questions of our time – climate change, food security, the role of commons, the rights of nature, equality – in a political arena that until recently appeared to offer no alternative to the \"one size fits all\" view of globalisation and the market.</p><p>Crucially, in most Latin American countries such dogmatic views were imposed by sheer force, either military – as in Chile, Brazil, Argentina or Bolivia –or paramilitary, as in Colombia. To most Colombians it is now clear – a matter of indisputable record – that the paramilitary violence that engulfed the country with peculiar intensity during the last decade and a half, with the leading intervention of the United States, was part and parcel of an economic project rather than solely a counter-insurgency exercise.</p><p>The model still in place depends on the unbridled extraction of natural resources from parts of the country that have traditionally sustained peasant, indigenous and Afro-Colombian ways of life, and is the result of such violence. Because of this, as far as the social movements are concerned, any peace process worthy of the name must also consider the serious ethical questions posited by climate change science, food security and so on.</p><p>According to the information provided by climate science, as well as from anthropology and the humanities, it is no longer possible to keep human history separate from the history of the planet. We have become geological agents, capable of affecting and even destroying nature as a whole. We do this through the very processes that we considered to be at the heart of freedom in the 20th century – chief among them free trade. What we need now is a new politics, not only a politics of freedom, but one of post-human rights and cosmopolitics.</p><p>• A panel discussion – Colombia's resources: blessing or curse? – <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar/event_detail.aspx?eventId=1455\">will take place at the British Museum on 13 February at 8pm</a> </p>","headline":"Latin America is being

While he remains in the job, both Indonesians and Australians will stay convinced about the nature of Australia&rsquo;s asylum-seeker problems, and that whatever he is doing is necessary to deal with that problem.</p> <p>The reasons why Australians fear and resent asylum seekers has been well-covered: fear of strains upon current social infrastructure, impressions that asylum-seekers aren&rsquo;t genuinely in need of care or assistance, and resentment at becoming embroiled in the political problems of other countries. Whether you give him blame or credit, Morrison&rsquo;s role in fostering those impressions is substantial.</p> <p>Morrison has convinced Australians that asylum seekers who come by sea are less likely to be genuine refugees than those who come by other means. He has done this after years of seeking out media opportunities where he is not rebutted or questioned on the basis of research and established fact, where his is the voice of authority, and preferably with interviewers drawing out the very messages he wants to get across. The recent <a href=\"http://essentialvision.com.au/treatment-of-asylum-seekers\">Essential poll</a> indicating that current asylum-seeker deterrent policies are just right and working well depend on the assumptions that Morrison has cultivated so hard for so long.</p> <p>In fact,<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/overwhelming-majority-of-boat-arrivals-deemed-to-be-refugees-20130519-2juty.html\"> 90% of asylum-seekers who arrive by boat</a> are found to be genuine refugees. If that were more widely known, current policies about turning boats around and detaining refugees would be unsustainable.</p> <p>Any politician seeing to turn around the assumptions about who refugees are, what they really want and how we should treat them, will need to engage in the sort of slow, patient work that John Howard engaged in to sell GST and gun reform, or that Paul Keating did with macroeconomic reforms.</p> <p>Morrison is not that person: firstly, his current position has worked pretty well for him, and his political persona is pretty much tied up with a hard line on asylum-seekers. Damascene conversions are rare these days even in Damascus, and a careerist like Morrison is unlikely to be convincing.</p> <p>The whole idea of voting for the Abbott government, including Morrison as immigration minister, was so that they might allay the fears to which they drew attention, if not fostered. Morrison promised to stop the boats even though the forces that motivate boat-borne asylum-seekers are beyond his control. Rather than allay the fears of Australians, the incursions of Australian naval vessels hunting asylum-seekers into Indonesian waters has opened up a whole new fronts of fear.</p> <p>Since Indonesia imploded politically in the 1960s, Australians have feared the potential destructive power of its northern neighbour. Australian troops played a small role in buttressing Malaysia in its <em>konfrontasi</em> with Indonesia, and when Australia later committed troops to Vietnam many believed it an unnecessary <a href=\"http://www.dva.gov.au/commems_oawg/commemorations/education/Documents/avw_topic1.pdf\">diversion from Indonesia</a>. A generation of tense stand-offs and misunderstandings followed under President Suharto (1965-1998), before Australian troops led UN forces into East Timor, facing down opposition from militia backed half-heartedly and informally by the Indonesian government.</p> <p>Foreign minister Julie Bishop does not appear to be able to put Australia&rsquo;s relationship with Indonesia on the same footing it had under the previous government, let alone (as promised) improve it. Prime minister Tony Abbott appears committed to current asylum-seeker policies but he admits to being \"a weathervane\" on issues where the political winds are shifting, such as climate change. In his first tour of other countries as prime minister, Abbott seemed to have different messages for different audiences. If Abbott had to change his position on asylum-seekers, he would; any affection for Morrison would be balanced against what he saw as the wider needs of his government.</p> <p>Indonesia is a growing power, and growing powers throw their weight around. Strategic analysts <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/why-we-need-deeper-ties-with-indonesia/story-e6frgd0x-1226730270637\">within Australia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/editorial-indonesia-must-back-soft-power-with-hard/\">Indonesia</a> and elsewhere have identified this as a trend that other countries, including Australia, must take into account. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/australia-apologises-patrol-boats-indonesian-waters\">The Indonesian government has asked Australia to stop policies that lead to incursions into its waters</a>, not just the incursions themselves. So long as Morrison remains Australia&rsquo;s immigration minister the motivation for those incursions remains, and nobody &ndash; Indonesian, Australian or anyone else &ndash; can be sure they and other breaches will not continue.</p> <p>Many thousands of Australians enjoy holidaying in Bali or elsewhere in Indonesia. If that becomes impossible due to that country&rsquo;s escalating tensions with Morrison, I pity him and his staff as the grief and anger will be profound.</p> <p>The removal of Morrison from the Australian immigration portfolio would send the signal that Australia was rethinking its approach to asylum seekers coming to Australia from Indonesia. Such hopes may be dashed, depending on who Morrison&rsquo;s successor is and what he or she does; but two facts remain while Morrison is in place. First, Morrison is locked in tight with the current arrangements, including motivations to get around niceties like respecting other countries&rsquo; borders and obligations to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/african-asylum-seekers-say-australian-navy-inflicted-burns-kicked-them-20140122-317wa.html\">investigate asylum-seekers&rsquo; claims</a>. Secondly, he has no motivation to change his ways, and no political scope to do so even if he wished.</p>","headline":"Australia-Indonesia relations: the downward spiral won't stop until Morrison
