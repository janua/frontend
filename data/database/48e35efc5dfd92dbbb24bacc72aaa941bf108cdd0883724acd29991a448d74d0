The supermarket chain blamed consumers' lack of spare cash and its lack of a home delivery service and too few convenience stores for a 5.6% fall in sales at established branches in the six weeks to 5 January.</p><p>The chief executive, Dalton Philips, said: \"In a very tough market our sales performance over Christmas was disappointing.\" He said shoppers who would traditionally stock up for Christmas at Morrisons had instead turned to discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p><p>Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket chain, also announced worse-than-expected Christmas sales, which fell by 2.4% in the UK. \"Clearly Christmas was disappointing,\" said the chief executive, Philip Clarke.</p><p>Clarke said that while online and convenience store revenue had risen, the group's large out-of-town stores had suffered falling sales. He said: \"It's tough because the market is tough and consumers are still feeling they don't have as much to spend.\"</p><p>Adding to the grim day for big retailers, Marks &amp; Spencer said non-food sales in the three months to 28 December fell below its own expectations. Group like-for-like sales in the eight weeks before Christmas were up 1% but over the past three months they were down.</p><p>Marc Bolland, the M&amp;S chief executive, blamed unusually warm weather in October for the sales fall and said improved business over Christmas, helped by big discounts, could not make up the lost ground. Turning round M&amp;S's ailing clothing business is Bolland's biggest headache.</p><p>All three bosses are under pressure to revive their businesses while dealing with fierce competition and reduced household spending power. Morrisons is trying to catch up with its rivals in the growth areas of online sales and convenience stores while Tesco is ploughing money into its long-neglected UK stores. Both are losing out to Aldi and Lidl, which have claimed record UK Christmas trading.</p><p>M&amp;S's food business performed solidly but Bolland needs to revamp the group's clothing range, which is losing out to Next, arch-rival John Lewis and high-fashion chains such as Zara.</p><p>Bolland blamed other retailers for starting a price war in December that he said had forced M&amp;S to offer discounts of up to 30% on general merchandise. Debenhams discounted aggressively in the runup to Christmas and unveiled a profit warning last week.</p><p>\"Holding our nerve was something we were doing but the market didn't. We were not the first in; we were one of the last.\"</p><p>M&amp;S said its discounting would reduce the profit margin in general merchandise.</p><p>Britain's big retailers face multiple problems – shoppers are buying more online and are cutting back on big weekend trips to the supermarket. With incomes squeezed by rising prices and stagnant wages they are spending less and taking their custom to discount chains.</p><p>Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, said: \"The big companies have been resting on their laurels. This means while they are trying to change things around the fringe, they may have overlooked the reason that customers go to them in the first place – for good value in the case of Tesco or for quality in the case of M&amp;S.\"</p><p>While John Lewis uses its stores to let shoppers browse, have a coffee and order online, \"going into the average Tesco is a depressing experience most people avoid if they can\", he added.</p>","headline":"Dire day for UK high street as retailers reveal poor Christmas trading","trailText":"Morrisons issues surprise profit warning in tough market while Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer post worse-than-expected sales","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yyfc","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254073008/Morrisons-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254073008/Morrisons-003.jpg","wordcount":"578","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426640653","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8533710","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sean Farrell and Sarah Butler","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2023392","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-12T07:55:55Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/morrisons-issues-profit-warning-sales-down","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/09/morrisons-issues-profit-warning-sales-down","tags":[{"id":"business/morrisons","webTitle":"Morrisons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/morrisons","references":[]},{"id":"business/supermarkets","webTitle":"Supermarkets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/supermarkets","references":[]},{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"business/tesco","webTitle":"Tesco","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/tesco","references":[]},{"id":"business/marksspencer","webTitle":"Marks & Spencer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/marksspencer","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sarahbutler","webTitle":"Sarah Butler","r2ContributorId":"25439","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarahbutler","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426640860","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254070059/Morrisons-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"David Levene","photographer":"David Levene","altText":"Morrisons","height":"54","credit":"David Levene/David Levene","caption":"Morrisons, Tesco and Marks & Spencer have all posted disappointing trading over the crucial Christmas period.

The doors open at 9am sharp; the basics – cardigans, socks and slippers – are laid out in perfect rows, while the smell of baking bread wafts through the food aisles.  M&amp;S is spending £2.4bn sprucing up its stores, and in this inner London store it shows. But none of it really matters if the product isn't right, says Maureen Hinton, a veteran retail analyst for Conlumino, who puts herself squarely in M&amp;S's target market. M&amp;S should be making clothes for \"the new older woman\", 50+, still working, with money to spend and no wish to dress like her mother. This new older woman might shop at Zara for a stylish jacket or bright statement piece. But she won't find much in M&amp;S on Holloway Road.</p><p>\"It is 50 shades of mushroom,\" says Hinton looking at the cosy cardigans in muted shades of grey, beige or sugary pastels. \"My mother would have worn any of these classic items but I won't be seen dead in them.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426643371'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254782763/MS-cardigans-at-the-Hollo-009.jpg' alt='M&S cardigans at the Holloway Road store' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>M&S cardigans at the Holloway Road store</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't always like this. A generation ago the nation shopped at Marks and Spencer, a retail empire whose (now defunct) <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/674973.stm\" title=\"\">St Michael logo</a> made it an institution. \"It used to be top of the list for clothes shopping for the whole population,\" says Hinton, who remembers when everyone in her office wore the same M&amp;S linen shirt in a different shade.</p><p>These days, office workers go to Next, a brand created in 1982 that is expected to make bigger profits this year than its 130-year rival for the first time ever. Next had a great Christmas, with sales up 12% on last year as shoppers snapped up its festive jumpers. \"Next has got a very clearly defined customer – the 25-45 year old and some either side,\" says Hinton. \"They just keep targeting that age group and they do it well.\" She credits Next for weaning itself off safe basics, with fashionable lines that have broadened its appeal.</p><p>M&amp;S is no stranger to the fashion pages. The 2014 spring-summer collection, from <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/20/belinda-earl-m-and-s-style-director\" title=\"\">style director Belinda Earl</a> –  floral print bomber jackets and brilliant white shirts and trousers – <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2013/11/13/belinda-earl-launches-second-marks-and-spencer-collection\" title=\"\">was trailed in Vogue</a>. The glossies whipped up a fuss over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/oct/14/pink-coat-fashion-buy-ask-hadley\" title=\"\">a pink coat</a> in Earl's Autumn collection. But such runway-inspired designs are thin on the ground at Holloway Road, with its generous supply of floral nightgowns and sensible cardigans.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426643369'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389255519883/MS-nightwear-at-Holloway--008.jpg' alt='M&S nightwear at Holloway Road' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>M&S nightwear at Holloway Road</figcaption></figure><p>\"[This] should be a good [profitable] store because there is a high density of population and there is not a lot else on offer.\"  But its residents are younger than the national average and Hinton is struck by the disconnect between the old-fashioned range and the younger women rifling through the sale rack.  The only range clearly targeted at younger shoppers in this store is Indigo: casual floral tops and cosy jumpers for people who might shop at Fat Face, but without \"the energy and excitement \" necessary.</p><p>In many ways, M&amp;S has fallen victim to the curse of dominance, an affliction shared by another middle-of-the road giant – Tesco. \"If you are the market leader and you have so many stores, it is a real problem in a market that's not growing, to generate more and more sales and attract new people.\"</p><p>Things look brighter at M&amp;S food. Sales remain robust, despite tougher than ever competition from Waitrose, another winner in the Christmas battle for the nation's wallets. But M&amp;S food is  more a place for treats and top-up shops, rather than the weekly shop, Hinton says.</p><p>Ultimately, M&amp;S boss Marc Bolland will not be judged on teatime treats and meal deals, but clothing. Hinton thinks he has another three months to prove his turnaround strategy will work before shareholders start grumbling.</p><p>But harder questions are down the road. M&amp;S has around 770 UK stores, \"far too many\" for an online future, Hinton thinks. And with its limited appeal to younger shoppers, M&amp;S is unlikely ever to return to its glory days: \"There are people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who don't shop there anymore – and this is a fierce market.\"</p>","headline":"M&amp;S store revamps may not be enough, analyst says","trailText":"<p>Products must also appeal to the new style-conscious M&amp;S customer, Conlumino retail analyst

It's tougher for customers today than it's been in a generation.</p><p>\"The economy is in recovery and that's manifesting itself in more jobs, but the vast majority of people who have stayed in work have got less money in their pockets.\" He said he expected shoppers to remain cautious for \"quite a while\".</p><p>While the three-monthly performance was better than analysts expected, shares in the grocer sank 2.4% to 360p as Sainsbury's said it was set to record underlying sales growth of just below 1% for its full year against its previous prediction of up to 1.5%.</p><p>King admitted that Sainsbury's total rise in sales, excluding fuel, of 2.7% over the quarter was flattered by food price inflation and strong sales of general merchandise such as clothing as well as new store space. General merchandise, which also includes homewares, is more profitable than food sales and the better performance of those goods may help the chain raise its profit margins.</p><p>Aldi, Lidl and the upmarket Waitrose chain all saw much bigger sales gains over Christmas, but King insisted Sainsbury's was now more competitive than ever on price and had not lost customers to either discounters or upmarket rivals.</p><p>\"I think shoppers are buying a little bit less but a little bit better quality,\" he said pointing to a 10% increase in sales of Sainsbury's premium own-label range, Taste the Difference.</p><p>Waitrose, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, revealed on Wednesday a 3.1% rise in underlying sales in the five weeks to Christmas Eve boosted by a 33% rise in online grocery sales.</p><p>The Co-op, meanwhile, said it had seen a 1% rise in underlying sales at its grocery stores in the 13 weeks to 4 January, boosted by a bigger rise in sales at its small local stores. Upmarket Majestic Wine also revealed its Christmas results, with sales up 2.8%.</p><p>Independent market share figures will not be released until next week, but Sainsbury's relative performance should become clearer on Thursday when Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, reveals its Christmas trading figures. Analysts expect Tesco to reveal like-for-like sales down by about 2%.</p><p>Bryan Roberts, director at industry analysts Kantar Retail, said: \"The fact Sainsbury's has posted an increase of only 0.2% in like-for-like sales is indicative of a slowdown by the retailer. In context of the likely performance of major competitors and against last year's decent comparatives, however, this is another respectable showing.</p><p>\"Although Sainsbury's is among the better placed supermarkets to cope with whatever the market throws at it, we retain concerns that its profitability will come under mounting pressure in 2014.\"</p><p>All the food retailers to have reported performance so far have noted a late rush, promotions that were heavier than usual and strong performances online and in convenience stores.</p><p>Mike Coupe, commercial director at Sainsbury's said: \"Christmas is always promotional but this year was like no other.\" He said several stores had brought forward promotions that they might usually have launched in January.</p><p>He added that trading was particularly difficult in October and November as customers kept a tight rein on spending after splashing out over the unusually warm summer.</p><p>Trading also suffered as Halloween and Bonfire Night, both of which usually boost sales at supermarkets as the nation prepares to party, were literally a \"wash out,\" according to Coupe, marred by rain in many parts of the country.</p><p>King said Sainsbury's had been able to achieve its 36th consecutive quarter of underlying sales growth largely thanks to a strong December. The chain had its busiest ever week leading up to Christmas with more than 28m transactions.</p>","headline":"Sainsbury's posts lowest sales growth for nine years","trailText":"<p>Despite record pre-Christmas turnover, supermarket reins in 2014 expectations</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"26","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ykgm","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389169500791/Sainsbury-s-chief-Justin--006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389169500791/Sainsbury-s-chief-Justin--006.jpg","wordcount":"723","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426549515","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8528022","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sarah Butler and Sean Farrell","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2022700","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-11T08:27:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/08/sainsburys-busiest-week-christmas-shoppers-nectar","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/08/sainsburys-busiest-week-christmas-shoppers-nectar","tags":[{"id":"business/j-sainsbury","webTitle":"J Sainsbury","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/j-sainsbury","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/j-sainsbury","references":[]},{"id":"business/supermarkets","webTitle":"Supermarkets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/supermarkets","references":[]},{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/financial3","webTitle":"Financial","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sarahbutler","webTitle":"Sarah Butler","r2ContributorId":"25439","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarahbutler","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426654601","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389169489282/Sainsbury-s-chief-Justin--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Dan Kitwood","altText":"Sainsbury’s chief Justin King","height":"54","credit":"Dan Kitwood/Getty Images","caption":"Sainsbury’s chief Justin King was cautious about the outlook as cash-strapped customers rein in spending.

The doors open at 9am sharp; the basics – cardigans, socks and slippers – are laid out in perfect rows, while the smell of baking bread wafts through the food aisles.  M&amp;S is spending £2.4bn sprucing up its stores, and in this inner London store it shows. But none of it really matters if the product isn't right, says Maureen Hinton, a veteran retail analyst for Conlumino, who puts herself squarely in M&amp;S's target market. M&amp;S should be making clothes for \"the new older woman\", 50+, still working, with money to spend and no wish to dress like her mother. This new older woman might shop at Zara for a stylish jacket or bright statement piece. But she won't find much in M&amp;S on Holloway Road.</p><p>\"It is 50 shades of mushroom,\" says Hinton looking at the cosy cardigans in muted shades of grey, beige or sugary pastels. \"My mother would have worn any of these classic items but I won't be seen dead in them.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426643371'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254782763/MS-cardigans-at-the-Hollo-009.jpg' alt='M&S cardigans at the Holloway Road store' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>M&S cardigans at the Holloway Road store</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't always like this. A generation ago the nation shopped at Marks and Spencer, a retail empire whose (now defunct) <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/674973.stm\" title=\"\">St Michael logo</a> made it an institution. \"It used to be top of the list for clothes shopping for the whole population,\" says Hinton, who remembers when everyone in her office wore the same M&amp;S linen shirt in a different shade.</p><p>These days, office workers go to Next, a brand created in 1982 that is expected to make bigger profits this year than its 130-year rival for the first time ever. Next had a great Christmas, with sales up 12% on last year as shoppers snapped up its festive jumpers. \"Next has got a very clearly defined customer – the 25-45 year old and some either side,\" says Hinton. \"They just keep targeting that age group and they do it well.\" She credits Next for weaning itself off safe basics, with fashionable lines that have broadened its appeal.</p><p>M&amp;S is no stranger to the fashion pages. The 2014 spring-summer collection, from <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/20/belinda-earl-m-and-s-style-director\" title=\"\">style director Belinda Earl</a> –  floral print bomber jackets and brilliant white shirts and trousers – <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2013/11/13/belinda-earl-launches-second-marks-and-spencer-collection\" title=\"\">was trailed in Vogue</a>. The glossies whipped up a fuss over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/oct/14/pink-coat-fashion-buy-ask-hadley\" title=\"\">a pink coat</a> in Earl's Autumn collection. But such runway-inspired designs are thin on the ground at Holloway Road, with its generous supply of floral nightgowns and sensible cardigans.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426643369'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389255519883/MS-nightwear-at-Holloway--008.jpg' alt='M&S nightwear at Holloway Road' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>M&S nightwear at Holloway Road</figcaption></figure><p>\"[This] should be a good [profitable] store because there is a high density of population and there is not a lot else on offer.\"  But its residents are younger than the national average and Hinton is struck by the disconnect between the old-fashioned range and the younger women rifling through the sale rack.  The only range clearly targeted at younger shoppers in this store is Indigo: casual floral tops and cosy jumpers for people who might shop at Fat Face, but without \"the energy and excitement \" necessary.</p><p>In many ways, M&amp;S has fallen victim to the curse of dominance, an affliction shared by another middle-of-the road giant – Tesco. \"If you are the market leader and you have so many stores, it is a real problem in a market that's not growing, to generate more and more sales and attract new people.\"</p><p>Things look brighter at M&amp;S food. Sales remain robust, despite tougher than ever competition from Waitrose, another winner in the Christmas battle for the nation's wallets. But M&amp;S food is  more a place for treats and top-up shops, rather than the weekly shop, Hinton says.</p><p>Ultimately, M&amp;S boss Marc Bolland will not be judged on teatime treats and meal deals, but clothing. Hinton thinks he has another three months to prove his turnaround strategy will work before shareholders start grumbling.</p><p>But harder questions are down the road. M&amp;S has around 770 UK stores, \"far too many\" for an online future, Hinton thinks. And with its limited appeal to younger shoppers, M&amp;S is unlikely ever to return to its glory days: \"There are people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who don't shop there anymore – and this is a fierce market.\"</p>","headline":"M&amp;S store revamps may not be enough, analyst says","trailText":"<p>Products must also appeal to the new style-conscious M&amp;S customer, Conlumino retail analyst

Some retailers, for example, exclude stores which have had refurbishment work or include extra space from store expansions, decisions which can have a significant impact on the figures they report.</p><p>One area that is particularly topical, is the the handling of internet sales, because of the issue of returned goods. Up to half of the goods sold online by clothing retailers, for example, are returned. Many retailers adjust their like-for-like sales figures to account for their average rate of returns – but not all of them. It is not always clear how different companies handle the issue, while the inclusion of fast-growing online sales in \"like-for-like\" figures at all is controversial because it masks the underlying performance of a retailer's store estate.</p><p>Julie Carlyle, a member of the working group behind the report and head of retail at accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, said: \"There is massive pressure on retailers to produce positive numbers after the Christmas period, as these figures are widely reported. However, care must be taken when looking at the top line like-for-like sales figures released. The much publicised differences in promotional strategies over the festive period emphasise the ability of like-for-like sales to mask real performance and raise the question whether we should be looking at like-for-like margin.\"</p><p>Carlyle said: \"It is critical for retail businesses to have the right data to respond in such a rapidly changing world and this is becoming more difficult. The ambiguity around which part of the business is generating revenue can also impact on staff incentives, negotiations with landlords over rent payments and reporting to shareholders.\"</p>","headline":"Auditors say retailers' like-for-like Christmas sales reporting 'problematic'","trailText":"Accountants say like-for-like sales are not calculated on a consistent basis and lack profitability guidance","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yy7d","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389202222906/Christmas-Shoppers-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389202222906/Christmas-Shoppers-003.jpg","wordcount":"395","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"426602347","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8528490","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sarah Butler","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2023177","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-12T06:00:01Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/auditors-retailers-christmas-sales-reporting-problematic","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/09/auditors-retailers-christmas-sales-reporting-problematic","tags":[{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/accountancy","webTitle":"Accountancy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/accountancy","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/accountancy","references":[]},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-sector","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/financial-sector","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sarahbutler","webTitle":"Sarah Butler","r2ContributorId":"25439","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarahbutler","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426602784","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389202218862/Christmas-Shoppers-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Dan Kitwood","altText":"Christmas Shoppers","height":"54","credit":"Dan Kitwood/Getty Images","caption":"Auditors have warned that like-for-like sales, a closely watched performance measure, should be treated carefully.

Total group sales were down 6.1%.</p><p>Simon Calver, Mothercare's chief executive, said: \"In the UK, our stores suffered similar Christmas trading pressures to those reported elsewhere. Customer service scores continue to improve year on year but weaker footfall and higher promotional activity led to lower sales and margins.\"</p><p>\"A lot of value was coming out of the market, we needed to discount to be in there,\" he said.</p><p>Calver said the company's Early Learning Centre chain was particularly hard hit as the whole market was forced into earlier than usual discounting amid competition from high-tech alternatives such as tablet computers.</p><p>The chain's online sales, meanwhile, took a knock from a decision to halt free delivery on sales worth less than £50, a service that proved unprofitable the year before.</p><p>While online sales at Mothercare.com rose 15% - 20% for the quarter, total direct sales slid 1% because of the poor performance from its sister brand.</p><p>Calver admitted Mothercare's problems were not only the result of external factors. \"Clearly we didn't do everything right,\" he said. \"We are in the middle of a turnaround but we would like to be further ahead with our ranges, pricing and product in stores.\" He said the company could also improve its online service.</p><p>Calver has been trying to revive Mothercare by closing unprofitable stores, revamping the remaining branches, improving customer service and increasing international sales. The latest poor figures come despite the closure of about 70 poorly performing stores since Calver's revival plan began. Meanwhile, the retailer faces increasing competition on toys and clothing from growing specialists such as Kiddicare, which is now owned by supermarket Morrisons, as well as John Lewis, Amazon, Argos and the supermarkets.</p><p>\"The UK baby clothing and equipment market remains very competitive with few retailers in this category making any positive retail margins, especially as high street clothing chains, internet offers and supermarkets continue to grow space and share,\" said Mike Dennis, an analyst at City broker Cantor.</p><p>Mothercare's experience reflected the story at Debenhams, the department store group which also blamed heavy promotional activity and cautious shoppers for its profit warning earlier this month. In contrast private clothing retailer New Look is understood to have seen a 1.5% rise in same-store sales in the seven weeks to the end of the year.</p><p>The retailer introduced price cuts of up to 50% on key seasonal product categories including knitwear and outerwear in the weeks before Christmas but discounted less overall than in the same period a year before.</p><p>Today (Thursday) market bellwether Marks &amp; Spencer will reveal how it fared over Christmas in the face of an overall 9.9% slump in clothing prices in December, according to figures from the British Retail Consortium. While M&amp;S is thought likely to have seen strong food sales, expectations for clothing are low after the store began offering 30% off knitwear, one of its Christmas best sellers, a week before Christmas and expanded that offer to all clothing in the weekend before December 25.</p>","headline":"Mothercare shares plunge 30% on Christmas trading profit warning","trailText":"<p>Mother and baby retailer's estimated annual profit halved to £8m after pre-Christmas sales fall</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"26","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ykt2","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389175933678/Mothercare-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389175933678/Mothercare-006.jpg","wordcount":"643","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426556890","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8528120","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sarah Butler and Sean Farrell","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2022734","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-11T10:18:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/08/mothercare-shares-plunge-christmas-profit-warning","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/08/mothercare-shares-plunge-christmas-profit-warning","tags":[{"id":"business/mothercare","webTitle":"Mothercare","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mothercare","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/mothercare","references":[]},{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sarahbutler","webTitle":"Sarah Butler","r2ContributorId":"25439","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarahbutler","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/financial3","webTitle":"Financial","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426654653","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389175922613/Mothercare-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bloomberg","altText":"Mothercare","height":"54","credit":"Bloomberg/Getty Images","caption":"Mothercare: weaker footfall and higher promotional activity led to lower sales and margins.

That's a double whammy of good news for cash-conscious customers, and confirms our predictions that retailers worked hard to help budgets go that bit further this Christmas,\" said BRC director general Helen Dickinson.</p><p>She pointed out that the day dubbed \"Cyber Monday\" by retailers, said to be the busiest online shopping day of the year, fell within the latest set of figures. Although the BRC/Nielsen data does not cover online prices the group said a number of retailers ran similar promotions in-store.</p><p>The discounts in December appeared to be deepest in clothing and footwear, with prices down 9.9% on the year. Electricals were down 3.5%, furniture prices fell 1.7% and the books, stationery and home entertainment category slipped into deflationary territory with prices down 1.4%.

Will all grocery shopping one day be done this way?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-09T21:41:29Z","body":"<p>Do you remember what the future of shopping used to be? In place of a trundle round the high street every few days, we were going to make weekly trips to big-box supermarkets outside town, delight in the bright produce and the enticing smells and drive home happy, our cars low on their axles. Well, there's a new future now: the \"dark store\", the supermarket that we never see at all.</p><p>Don't be too alarmed by the name, or too excited. Desynchronise your watches. A dark store is just a warehouse full of groceries where staff called \"pickers\" select the goods that have been ordered by an online customer. Sometimes they look almost creepily similar to normal supermarkets. In Hanger Lane, west London, Waitrose operates a dark store in an old John Lewis carpet warehouse. Inside, professional pickers roll baskets around the aisles much like civilians, except they are wrapped up in coats and scarves against the refrigeration system.</p><p>Elsewhere, they look like nothing you've ever seen. At Tesco's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QONyKR0KdYs\" title=\"\">sixth and newest dark store in Erith, south-east London</a>, they operate what is basically a giant robot butler, although they call it a \"goods-to-person pickstation\" and a \"dotcom centre\" (the supermarkets themselves aren't keen on the term \"dark store\"). Instead of laying out the groceries in aisles, at Erith they store most of them more efficiently in towers of blue crates. The robot extracts whatever is needed and brings it to the picker, who stands still (until it's time to visit the freezer).</p><p>\"It's a little bit like I imagine going into a Willy Wonka factory,\" says Jennifer Creevy, deputy editor of Retail Week. \"It looks really whizzy and there's crates moving around. It's really impressive.\" Organising things this way saves space and time, and creates a safer workplace, according to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTyOh1nlbA#t=53\" title=\"\">Dematic</a>, the company that built Tesco's robots. \"With its ergonomic design, you get 100% golden zone single-level picking,\" they say. And who are we to argue?</p><p>No one knows how much of our grocery shopping will eventually be done online, but everyone agrees it will be a lot more than now. In 2013, the proportion was about 5.5%. This year it should be around 6%. Within five years the value of the market is expected to double in size. Much of the current online demand is met by simply sending pickers around conventional supermarkets, although as demand rises that becomes less efficient, in part because the physically present customers keep getting in the way. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Waitrose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/06/supermarkets-open-dark-stores-online-food-shopping-expands\" title=\"\">all have plans to open new dark stores over the coming year or two</a>. \"It just makes sense,\" Creevy says. \"Online is just showing huge, huge growth. Online and convenience stores.\"</p><p>So in future, when people are doing all their boring and heavy shopping through dark stores, and all their interesting and urgent shopping through convenience stores and local shops, what is going to become of the big boxes? Tesco has already turned <a href=\"http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/food/analysis-tesco-watford-the-grocers-vision-for-big-box-retailing-is-exciting-relevant-and-convenient/5051904.article\" title=\"\">one in Watford into something more like a shopping mall</a>, with a cafe, a clothes shop, a restaurant and even a community centre. It's hard to imagine that strategy always working, however, since shopping malls already exist. And that may be no bad thing. Perhaps in 20 years you'll be out in the countryside and you'll be able to say to your bored grandchildren: \"I remember when all this was car parks.\"</p>","headline":"Inside the supermarkets' dark stores","trailText":"<p>As online shopping is growing, so are the supermarkets' giant warehouses – with their robots and \"goods-to-person pickstations\".

Just 12 months ago, the shares were changing hands at £39.05.</p><p>The group shrugged off fears that the festive season had been tough for clothing stores with a 12% rise in sales in the period from 1 November to 24 December compared with the same period a year before.</p><p>Next held out against a wave of discounting by rivals in the final trading days before Christmas, but doubled its pace of growth online from the previous quarter and experienced its strongest underlying growth in stores since the summer of 2002, according to analysts at Bernstein.</p><p>In light of that storming performance, Next raised its pre-tax profit forecast for 2013 by about 4% to a range of £684m to £700m, putting it well ahead of the City's expectations for the much bigger Marks &amp; Spencer, which is expected to make an annual profit of £650m.</p><p>Next's stock market value climbed to nearly £2bn more than Marks &amp; Spencer as it announced that a special dividend of 50p a share would be paid to shareholders in early February, at a cost of £75m. The company is planning to distribute a further £300m in 2014 via share buybacks and special dividends.</p><p>Next's healthy Christmas numbers come after John Lewis and House of Fraser reported a seasonal sales surge, boosted by performance online.</p><p>Out in the cold is Debenhams, which issued a profits warning and parted company with its finance director after disappointing sales.</p><p>Attention is now turning to Marks &amp; Spencer. Like Debenhams, the group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/18/marks-and-spencer-debenhams-slump-share-price\" title=\"\">slashed prices in a last-minute attempt to woo shoppers in the days leading up to Christmas</a>, raising fears that the high-street stalwart could also miss its profit targets.</p><p>A poor Christmas for Marks &amp; Spencer, which reveals its festive trading figures next week, would pile more pressure on the chief executive, Marc Bolland, who is trying to turn around years of poor clothing sales.</p><p>Analysts said that Next's strict policy of not discounting until the clearly defined start of its sale on Boxing Day was something other retailers should take heed of and had clearly not affected its ability to take market share.</p><p>Neil Saunders, at the retail analysts Conlumino, said: \"This is one of the reasons why Next is a festive winner in terms of both sales and profits.\"</p><p>Simon Wolfson, the chief executive, said Next had performed well partly because of shoppers' growing confidence in ordering online for delivery to homes and stores, which helped the company capitalise on a late surge in sales this year.</p><p>But he said sales had mainly been lifted because Next had got its ranges right this year, particularly on womenswear, after a not so sparkling year in 2012. \"We had a good season and a lot of ranges were better than the previous year.\"</p><p>Lord Wolfson warned that the retailer's strong performance was unlikely to continue in the first half of 2014 and sounded a warning about confidence among cash-strapped consumers.</p><p>\"The consumer hasn't had an awful lot more to spend. Looking forward, the environment will be better, just not a lot better,\" he said.</p><p>\"Although we have seen a return to economic growth and the credit squeeze on consumers is abating, earnings are not keeping up with inflation and so we are not expecting a return to the boom times.\"</p><p>On a day when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/03/manchester-tops-london-uk-2013-house-prices-rise\" title=\"\">Nationwide revealed that house prices rose by 8.4%</a> in 2013, Next sounded the alarm over a potential rise in interest rates adding further pressure on household incomes.</p><p>\"We are also wary that any return to significant economic growth is likely to result in rising interest rates which, in turn, is likely to moderate spending of those with mortgages,\" the company said.</p><p>The City took heart from Next's performance as it awaits a flurry of Christmas trading reports over the coming weeks. The supermarkets Tesco and Sainsbury's and the online grocer Ocado are scheduled to reveal trading figures next week.</p><h2>M&amp;S v Next</h2><p><strong>Marks &amp;

Herrick is also in line for up to £10,000 to cover legal fees incurred negotiating his departure.</p><p>Herrick's departure followed Wednesday's profits warning, prompted by heavy discounting at Debenhams over the festive period, and fury among suppliers over a demand, penned by Herrick, for a 2.5% \"Santa tax\" discount on goods days before Christmas.</p><p>However, the finance director's fate is thought to have been already sealed after a series of problems last year including an earlier profit warning last spring and a £25m hit for refurbishing the chain's leading store, on London's Oxford Street.</p><p>Some analysts, however, suggested that Herrick had been made a scapegoat and that Debenhams' true problems lay with its trading strategy.</p><p>Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \"Debenhams may be guilty of not listening to its customers and moving away from what they want it to be in a drive for profit margin.\"</p><p>He suggested it was relying too heavily on own-label merchandise, such as its Designers at Debenhams ranges, which is more profitable but arguably less desirable than third-party brands.</p><p>Black said: \"With Simon Herrick out of the way, if there isn't any improvement, it will be interesting to see how Debenhams' management evolves.\"</p><p>Freddie George, a retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said he believed Sharp's position was secure for the time being, but that Debenhams had potentially taken a mis-step by discounting early so that it did not get the full benefit of a late rush in sales enjoyed by its rivals House of Fraser and John Lewis.</p><p>Strong sales growth in the run-up to Christmas was reported by House of Fraser as the department store's owners look to offload the business in a private sale or stock market launch this year.</p><p>Underlying sales rose 4.3% in the nine weeks to 28 December – the company's \"best ever\" Christmas period – driven by a near-58% rise in online sales, with beauty products a particular success. Stores also saw a strong 3% rise in sales in three weeks to 28 December.</p><p>\"We are pleased to report another record performance despite a more competitive environment,\" said the chief executive, John King. He added that the company expected to report further growth in full-year earnings and finish its financial year with net debt lower than the £157m reported in 2013.</p><p>The positive performance will boost House of Fraser's hopes of securing a deal with Galeries Lafayette, the French department store group. The pair are in talks until the end of January. If the discussions fail the UK chain is expected to attempt a return to the stock market after more than seven years in private&nbsp;hands.</p><p>However, analysts questioned whether the group had been able to lift its percentage gross margin on each pound of sales, a measure that would indicate the level of discounting behind its sales growth.</p><p>While the company said its total cash gross margin, a measure of overall profitability, was up 8.7% compared with last year, Tony Shiret, a retail analyst at Espirito Santo, said: \"The position on discounting is not entirely clear.\"</p><p>King said he could not reveal the percentage gross margin but insisted that it was up, driven by an increase in the proportion of own-label clothes on offer, and a reduced amount of discounting compared with last year. He said House of Fraser had also benefited from selling aspirational brands such as Ralph Lauren and Barbour.

Underlying sales continued to fall in all Tesco's major overseas markets, contributing to a fall of 2.8% in like-for-like sales for the group over the period. Analysts had expected sales to fall by up to 2%.</p><p>Tesco's chief executive, Philip Clarke, said: \"Clearly Christmas was disappointing.\"</p><p>He said that while sales online and in convenience stores had risen, the group's large out-of-town stores had seen falls, partly because of Tesco's own move to limit sales of less profitable electrical goods but also because of shoppers' changing habits. \"It's tough because the market is tough and consumers are still feeling they don't have as much to spend,\" Clarke said.</p><p>Analysts said the trading figures implied that shoppers had bought substantially less from Tesco, given food price inflation of about 2.5%.</p><p>Clarke said Tesco had taken action to limit price increases below the market in the past six weeks and hinted that the company's profit margin of 5.2% might come down. \"In the last few weeks we have made an investment to make our offer more compelling to customers,\" he said.</p><p>Tesco said it expected full-year profit \"within the range of current market expectations\", but its shares fell almost 2% as the company admitted that those expectations were now between £50m and £150m below the reduced range set just a few weeks ago.</p><p>Analysts now expect profits for the group of between £3.16bn and £3.42bn. The finance director, Laurie McIlwee, who is under pressure from shareholders over his handling of profit forecasts, said: \"In hindsight we were a little too optimistic at the beginning of December. There has been further weakness across the whole of the grocery market which we didn't anticipate.\"</p><p>Tesco is 21 months into a turnaround plan for its main UK business, in which it has invested more than £1bn in store revamps, more staff, new product ranges and price cuts.</p><p>Clarke insisted that Tesco was making the right moves to cope with the changing consumer marketplace. \"There is a great global shift. We in Britain think it's only here but when I look around the world, people are shopping more locally, shopping online more and shopping a little more often,\" he said.</p><p>He said Tesco would cut back space in 100 stores over the next eight or nine years, handing it over to other complementary retailers such as Sports Direct or businesses such as gyms and children's play centres.</p><p>Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor, said that Tesco's performance was particularly poor given that it had introduced a new price matching promotion, refurbished more than 100 stores and given a high-profile relaunch to its premium food range, Tesco Finest.</p><p>\"Our view is that management still has a lot of explaining to do over the poor relative UK sales performance,\" he said. \"We believe this update will again show that Tesco has been unable to differentiate itself from the competition.\"</p>","headline":"Tesco admits profits will be hit by disappointing Christmas sales","trailText":"Britain's biggest supermarket chain says poor performance at large out-of-town stores dragged UK sales down 2.4%","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yygf","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389261644361/Tesco-001.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389261644361/Tesco-001.jpg","wordcount":"530","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426649045","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8533739","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sarah Butler","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2023422","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-12T10:11:12Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/tesco-warns-profits-lower-supermarket-christmas-sales","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/09/tesco-warns-profits-lower-supermarket-christmas-sales","tags":[{"id":"business/tesco","webTitle":"Tesco","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/tesco","references":[]},{"id":"business/supermarkets","webTitle":"Supermarkets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/supermarkets","references":[]},{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sarahbutler","webTitle":"Sarah Butler","r2ContributorId":"25439","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarahbutler","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426668066","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389261644361/Tesco-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Rex Features","photographer":"Alex Segre","altText":"Tesco","height":"84","credit":"Alex Segre/Rex Features","caption":"Tesco revealed a worse than expected 2.4% fall in sales excluding petrol at stores open for more than a year in the six weeks to 4 January.

The company blamed a squeeze on consumer spending power as well as its near exclusion from the fast-growing online and convenience-store markets for a 5.6% fall in underlying sales in the six weeks to 5 January. The fall came despite a 1% boost to sales from a new move to open on Boxing Day and New Year's Day, according to analysts.</p><p>Dalton Philips, the chief executive, said the retailer had also been unable to compete with a blizzard of discount voucher programmes offered by rivals whose more up-to-date IT systems allowed them to target customers more effectively. His comments reflect the view of Sainsbury's, which said on Wednesday that promotional activity this Christmas \"was like no other\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Philips admitted that Morrisons had faced a competitive onslaught from discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl. He attributed about half of the supermarket's fall in underlying sales to customers opting to shop around at discounters rather than consolidating their spending in Morrisons, as they had done over previous Christmases.</p><p>\"People are being economically squeezed so they are not trading up and they are splitting their shopping basket among different stores,\" he said. \"They have been buying their confectionery from one store and their wine from another store this year. It's a big shift.\"</p><p>All the major supermarkets lost market share to discounters and upmarket rivals such as Waitrose in October and November. Official figures are not yet out for December, but only Sainsbury's has said it believes it fought off competition from these fast-growing specialists.</p><p>Philips said Morrisons had been particularly vulnerable to competition from the discounters because of its greater presence in the north of England and its position at the lower end of the market.</p><p>However, Philips said that, while the retailer was moving down prices on key items such as butter, milk and bread, it would not be changing its strategy to take on the likes of Aldi more directly.</p><p>\"We have got a very clear strategy of developing new channels in online and convenience and fundamentally that's where all the growth is. We believe quality and convenience will win through with consumers and that's where long term we will win.\"</p><p>He said that Morrisons was already working on \"antidotes\" to three of its major issues with an online service launching in Warwickshire on Friday, two convenience stores opening every week and a new loyalty programme allowing Morrisons to offer shoppers more targeted promotions that will begin trials in the next couple of months. But he admitted: \"In a very tough market our sales performance over Christmas was disappointing.\"</p>","headline":"Morrisons issues profit warning after shoppers opt for discount Christmas","trailText":"Supermarket blames consumer spending squeeze and near exclusion from online and convenience-store markets","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yyj9","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389267966335/Morrisons-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389267966335/Morrisons-006.jpg","wordcount":"478","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426657111","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8533955","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sarah Butler","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2023497","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-12T11:54:02Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/morrisons-profit-warning-discount-christmas-aldi-lidl","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/09/morrisons-profit-warning-discount-christmas-aldi-lidl","tags":[{"id":"business/morrisons","webTitle":"Morrisons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/morrisons","references":[]},{"id":"business/supermarkets","webTitle":"Supermarkets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/supermarkets","references":[]},{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sarahbutler","webTitle":"Sarah Butler","r2ContributorId":"25439","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarahbutler","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426659519","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389267955854/Morrisons-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Bloomberg via Getty Images","altText":"Morrisons","height":"54","credit":"Bloomberg via Getty Images","caption":"Chief executive Dalton Philips said Morrisons had faced a competitive onslaught from discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl.

But for Tesco, the journey back to health will be of the 1,000-mile variety, and for now single steps will get them only so far. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/morrisons-issues-profit-warning-sales-down\" title=\"\">The company's latest results, in the UK at least, were weak</a>. Like-for-like (based on existing stores) sales were down 2.4% in the six weeks to 5 January. \"Clearly Christmas was disappointing,\" its chief executive, Philip Clarke, said.</p><p></p><p>Do not blame the boss. Tesco is a vast corporation operating in more than a dozen countries with half a million employees, and still making more than £3bn in profits annually. Clarke took over as CEO less than three years ago, after the 14-year reign of Sir Terry Leahy. If there are deep-seated problems at the company – and there are – then Clarke's job has been to sort out the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>A similar word of sympathy should be extended to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/08/manchester-united-players-manager-david-moyes-credentials-champions-league\" title=\"\">David Moyes, the manager of Manchester United</a>. For several years under its previous boss, Sir Alex Ferguson, the club had continued to win trophies, partly because of the weakness of its opponents, and partly through its own intimidating reputation. Ferguson's remarkable personality inspired his players to raise their game. But their vulnerability has been exposed now that a less superhuman figure is at the helm.</p><p></p><p>With success comes danger – the danger that an inevitable process of decline and fall must follow. The bad news from the high street is not limited to Tesco. Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons and especially Mothercare are all suffering, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/08/mothercare-shares-plunge-christmas-profit-warning\" title=\"\">with the latter being in the biggest trouble of all</a>. Each of these businesses has been a dominant player in the past. All must hope that they are not stuck on a decline and fall trajectory.</p><p></p><p>What are the symptoms of this corporate death spiral? The management guru Jim Collins defined them in his book of a few years ago How the Mighty Fall. He described a five-stage process, with self-explanatory headings to mark each one: hubris born of success, undisciplined pursuit of more, denial of risk and peril, grasping for salvation, capitulation to irrelevance or death. M&amp;S seems to have pulled out of this spiral round about stage four, which is where Morrisons finds itself now. Tesco only got as far as number three. But Mothercare may be on the verge of entering that fatal fifth category.</p><p></p><p>Failure is not inevitable. Companies and organisations that adapt and change with changing times have a future. And it may be possible to recover even when you are apparently on your death bed: the engineering firm Rolls-Royce had to be rescued by the Heath government in 1971 and is now a world-beater. Apple looked doomed until Steve Jobs returned from exile at the end of 1997 to revive his old company.</p><p></p><p>Leadership matters, but as well as the brilliant results of the day we have to look at the legacy. It is no use leaving employees, investors or supporters weeping and calling for more if things go wrong pretty soon after he or she has gone. But decline and fall is not necessarily a sign that a leader is indispensable. It may just mean that they haven't done a very good job in preparing their organisation for their departure. As the American journalist Walter Lippmann said: \"The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind him, in other men [and women], the conviction and the will to carry on.\"</p><p></p><p>The best leaders, Jim Collins says, worry most about the business, not themselves, and regard as a central task handing on a healthy organisation with a strong new leadership team. So while we continue to marvel at the Alex Fergusons and Steve Jobs, we cannot offer a conclusive view of their performance until several years after their career is over.</p><p></p><p>There have been too many political, corporate and sporting leaders who have been hailed as heroes in their lifetimes, only to find that their legacies are unhappy and troublesome. Problems have arisen even before the cheering has died down. Look on their works, ye mighty, and despair.</p>","headline":"If Tesco is in trouble, don't blame the boss","trailText":"<strong>Stefan Stern</strong>: Successful corporate leaders don't always leave great legacies.

The supermarket chain blamed consumers' lack of spare cash and its lack of a home delivery service and too few convenience stores for a 5.6% fall in sales at established branches in the six weeks to 5 January.</p><p>The chief executive, Dalton Philips, said: \"In a very tough market our sales performance over Christmas was disappointing.\" He said shoppers who would traditionally stock up for Christmas at Morrisons had instead turned to discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p><p>Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket chain, also announced worse-than-expected Christmas sales, which fell by 2.4% in the UK. \"Clearly Christmas was disappointing,\" said the chief executive, Philip Clarke.</p><p>Clarke said that while online and convenience store revenue had risen, the group's large out-of-town stores had suffered falling sales. He said: \"It's tough because the market is tough and consumers are still feeling they don't have as much to spend.\"</p><p>Adding to the grim day for big retailers, Marks &amp; Spencer said non-food sales in the three months to 28 December fell below its own expectations. Group like-for-like sales in the eight weeks before Christmas were up 1% but over the past three months they were down.</p><p>Marc Bolland, the M&amp;S chief executive, blamed unusually warm weather in October for the sales fall and said improved business over Christmas, helped by big discounts, could not make up the lost ground. Turning round M&amp;S's ailing clothing business is Bolland's biggest headache.</p><p>All three bosses are under pressure to revive their businesses while dealing with fierce competition and reduced household spending power. Morrisons is trying to catch up with its rivals in the growth areas of online sales and convenience stores while Tesco is ploughing money into its long-neglected UK stores. Both are losing out to Aldi and Lidl, which have claimed record UK Christmas trading.</p><p>M&amp;S's food business performed solidly but Bolland needs to revamp the group's clothing range, which is losing out to Next, arch-rival John Lewis and high-fashion chains such as Zara.</p><p>Bolland blamed other retailers for starting a price war in December that he said had forced M&amp;S to offer discounts of up to 30% on general merchandise. Debenhams discounted aggressively in the runup to Christmas and unveiled a profit warning last week.</p><p>\"Holding our nerve was something we were doing but the market didn't. We were not the first in; we were one of the last.\"</p><p>M&amp;S said its discounting would reduce the profit margin in general merchandise.</p><p>Britain's big retailers face multiple problems – shoppers are buying more online and are cutting back on big weekend trips to the supermarket. With incomes squeezed by rising prices and stagnant wages they are spending less and taking their custom to discount chains.</p><p>Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, said: \"The big companies have been resting on their laurels. This means while they are trying to change things around the fringe, they may have overlooked the reason that customers go to them in the first place – for good value in the case of Tesco or for quality in the case of M&amp;S.\"</p><p>While John Lewis uses its stores to let shoppers browse, have a coffee and order online, \"going into the average Tesco is a depressing experience most people avoid if they can\", he added.</p>","headline":"Dire day for UK high street as retailers reveal poor Christmas trading","trailText":"Morrisons issues surprise profit warning in tough market while Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer post worse-than-expected sales","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yyfc","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254073008/Morrisons-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254073008/Morrisons-003.jpg","wordcount":"578","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426640653","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8533710","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Sean Farrell and Sarah Butler","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2023392","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-12T07:55:55Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/morrisons-issues-profit-warning-sales-down","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/09/morrisons-issues-profit-warning-sales-down","tags":[{"id":"business/morrisons","webTitle":"Morrisons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/morrisons","references":[]},{"id":"business/supermarkets","webTitle":"Supermarkets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/supermarkets","references":[]},{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sean-farrell","webTitle":"Sean Farrell","r2ContributorId":"58999","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sean-farrell","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sean-farrell","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"business/tesco","webTitle":"Tesco","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/tesco","references":[]},{"id":"business/marksspencer","webTitle":"Marks & Spencer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/marksspencer","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sarahbutler","webTitle":"Sarah Butler","r2ContributorId":"25439","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahbutler","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarahbutler","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426640860","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389254070059/Morrisons-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"David Levene","photographer":"David Levene","altText":"Morrisons","height":"54","credit":"David Levene/David Levene","caption":"Morrisons, Tesco and Marks & Spencer have all posted disappointing trading over the crucial Christmas period.

The barrage of poor figures also highlighted a changing retail world in which shoppers are increasingly purchasing online and buying their groceries in small convenience stores or at discounters such as Aldi or Lidl.</p><p>IGD, the grocery industry research group, said that 50% of shoppers bought something in a food discounter in December. Sales have gone into reverse at large out of town stores as shoppers increasingly choose to buy little and often close to home, which helps cut down on waste and save petrol.</p><p>Shares in Morrisons sank nearly 8% to 234p as the Bradford-based chain surprised the City, bringing forward its Christmas trading update and warning profits would be at the bottom end of City forecasts. The update showed a dramatic 5.6% decline in sales at established branches in the crucial six weeks to 5 January.</p><p>The supermarket blamed a variety of factors for its dire performance, from shoppers choosing to spend more at discounters to its lack of an online grocery service, too few convenience stores and poor IT systems, which left it struggling to fight increasingly sophisticated promotions from rivals. The drop came despite help from food inflation and a 0.5% boost to underlying sales as a result of Morrisons opening its stores on Boxing Day and New Year's Day for the first time.</p><p>Its chief executive, Dalton Philips, said about half the fall in sales was linked to shoppers choosing to spend more money at discounters' stores than ever before at Christmas.</p><p>\"People are being economically squeezed so they are not trading up and they are splitting their shopping basket among different stores,\" he said. \"They have been buying their confectionery from one store and their wine from another store this year. It's a big shift.\"</p><p>Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket chain, also revealed worse-than-expected Christmas sales, down by 2.4% in the UK, when gains from new space and petrol sales were excluded . \"Clearly Christmas was disappointing,\" said its chief executive, Philip Clarke. The retailer admitted that profits would come in as much as £150m below expectations set only last month after a tough end to the year.</p><p>Clarke said online and convenience store revenue had risen, but the group's out-of-town superstores had suffered falling sales. He said: \"It's tough because the market is tough and consumers are still feeling they don't have as much to spend.\"</p><p>He said Tesco had taken action to limit price increases in the past six weeks and hinted that the company's profit margin of 5.2%, previously seen as a line in the sand, might come down.</p><p>Tesco and Morrisons performed markedly worse than rival Sainsbury's, but all have been battered by the discounters. Andrew Stevens, a retail analyst at Verdict Research, said the poor performance of the major grocers put the strength of Britain's economic recovery in doubt.</p><p>He added: \"The emergence of discounters as a bigger threat than many anticipated has meant the UK's largest grocers have emerged into 2014 with battle scars and nothing much to show for the fight.\"</p><p>M&amp;S said it had suffered its 10th quarter of declining like-for-like clothing and homewares sales, and it is now three years since the chain has seen underlying growth in its general merchandise business. It was forced into almost unprecedented discounting on key seasonal items such as knitwear in the week before Christmas. The poor sales came despite chief executive Marc Bolland's efforts to revamp clothing with a new management team, refurbished stores and huge investment in IT and logistics operations.</p><p>Bolland blamed unusually warm weather in October for the underlying sales fall and improved business in the final weeks before Christmas, helped by big discounts, could not make up the lost ground.</p><p>He accused other retailers of kicking off a price war in December, forcing M&amp;S to offer discounts of up to 30% on clothing in the week before Christmas Day. Rival Debenhams unveiled a profit warning last week after it discounted aggressively in the runup to Christmas, although clothing and homewares store Next – which refused to join in the price-cutting until Boxing Day – had a strong festive season .</p><p>Total UK sales rose 1.5%, helped by a 1.6% rise in underlying sales of food, as M&amp;S took a bigger share of the market over the festive season. But even the increase in M&amp;S food sales was less than City analysts had expected.</p><p>Finance director Alan Stewart said: \"Clearly our food business was a winner and had a very strong performance. Market expectations were higher but that was because it was a bit of a surprise that the market as a whole got worse.\"</p><p>Analysts said there was a sense of relief that trading hadn't been worse, but still trimmed their profit forecasts by about £20m to an average of £630m – down from £1bn in 2008.</p><p>The poor Christmas trading figures are not helpful for the bosses of Morrisons, Tesco and M&amp;S who are all under pressure to revive their businesses amid heavy competition in a tough and rapidly changing market. All three yesterday insisted they had the right strategy in place and merely needed more time.</p><p>Bolland, whose position at the top of M&amp;S has been questioned by some shareholders for several months, said: \"We are [heading] in the right direction. It is hard to get there but I take every quarter on the chin if need be because the company needs to go in the direction it is going.\"</p><p>But Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the retailers could not blame their woes entirely on problems in the market. \"I don't buy into the idea that all the factors were outside their control.\"</p><p>He pointed to the success of Aldi and Lidl as well as Waitrose, the Co-op and M&amp;S's food over Christmas. Convenience store group Nisa also revealed strong Christmas sales, up 15.3% in December on the previous year.</p><p>Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor, said Tesco's performance was particularly poor given that, 21 months into a £1bn turnaround plan, it had introduced a new price matching promotion, refurbished more than 100 stores and given a high-profile relaunch to its premium food range, Tesco Finest.</p><p>\"Our view is that management still has a lot of explaining to do over the poor relative UK sales performance,\" he said. \"Tesco has been unable to differentiate itself from the competition.\"</p><h2>Marks &amp; Spencer</h2><p>Christmas sales update: Food: +1.6%</p><p>Fashion and home: -2.1%</p><p>Chief executive: Marc Bolland, since 2010</p><p>Turnover 2013:
