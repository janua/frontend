The new film, with a screenplay by Tropic Thunder’s Justin Theroux, is expected to see the return of Owen Wilson as rival supermodel Hansel and Will Ferrell as fashion industry mogul Mugatu. Stiller will naturally be back in the director’s chair, and will reprise his role as Zoolander. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtQq0T3ExLs\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YtQq0T3ExLs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The actor and film-maker said in 2010 that the sequel would focus on how the fashion industry has moved on in the years since Stiller and Wilson fought it out for catwalk supremacy. “In the fashion world, if you go away for a year, it’s changed - it just happens so quickly,” he told MTV. “I think the idea in the beginning of the movie is that it’s 10 years later, and Derek and Hansel are literally forgotten. Nobody remembers who they are, so they have to reinvent themselves.”</p> <p><br />Zoolander 2 is due to arrive in the wake of success for Jim Carrey comeback Dumb and Dumber To at the weekend. The Farrelly brothers’ sequel topped the US box office with an opening haul of $36.1m, 20 years after the 1994 original introduced bumbling buffoons Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne.</p>","headline":"Really, really, ridiculously good looking Penelope Cruz set for Zoolander 2","trailText":"The Oscar-winning actor will join Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell for the further adventures of Derek Zoolander, who must reinvent himself in a fast-changing fashion environment","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416565572429/0a866384-2dab-46dd-8dcd-c88c49cd1837-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"273","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-24T10:30:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/21/penelope-cruz-set-for-zoolander-2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/21/penelope-cruz-set-for-zoolander-2","tags":[{"id":"film/penelopecruz","webTitle":"Penélope Cruz","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/penelopecruz","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/penelopecruz","references":[]},{"id":"film/woodyallen","webTitle":"Woody Allen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/woodyallen","references":[]},{"id":"film/benstiller","webTitle":"Ben Stiller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/benstiller","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/benstiller","references":[]},{"id":"film/owenwilson","webTitle":"Owen Wilson","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/owenwilson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/owenwilson","references":[]},{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/fashion","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","firstName":"ben","lastName":"child","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a journalist, DJ and producer whose main interests lie in the worlds of film and music</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"6d633220ca8e835a27071825664fc01f4118777b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416565571847/0a866384-2dab-46dd-8dcd-c88c49cd1837-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416565571847/0a866384-2dab-46dd-8dcd-c88c49cd1837-220x132.jpeg","source":"AFP","photographer":"TIMOTHY A.

Disney has adopted the character as its own since the classic 1953 animated version of Peter Pan, but does not own the rights as Barrie’s book went out of copyright in the US in the early part of this century. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jul/22/the-heat-trailer-paul-feig-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3hf54\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1940008\"                data-video-name=\"The Heat: watch the trailer for Paul Feig's cop comedy - video\"                data-video-provider=\"20th Century Fox\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-413359099\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/poster/2013/7/22/130722TheHeat_7865629.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/7/22/130722TheHeat-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/7/22/130722TheHeat_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/7/22/130722TheHeat/130722TheHeat.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/7/22/130722TheHeat_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch Melissa McCarthy in the trailer for The Heat</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Originally depicted in the theatre with a darting light created by a small off stage hand mirror, Tinker Bell remained voiceless in the 1953 Disney film but has since been portrayed by actors such as Julia Roberts (in 1991’s Hook) and Ludivine Sagnier (2003’s Peter Pan). </p> <p>McCarthy is best known for her supporting roles in Bridesmaids.

answer to Free Willy and E.T. emotively celebrates an unconventional friendship – minus the super serve of cheese</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Films about the relationship between children and their pets often embody one of the most powerful themes in coming of age stories: the idea of loving something and learning to let it go. </p> <p>Movies such as Free Willy and E.T. distill that theme into actual visual moments – the whale jumps over the rocks, the alien flies off with the mothership – while others, like director Henri Safran’s 1976 heart-tugger Storm Boy (based on author Colin Thiele’s children’s book) avoid postcard moments in favour of richer and more subtle gestures. </p> <p>Shot along the coast of Coorong in South Australia, near the mouth of the Murray River, beautiful opening images of the sky and the coastline zoom into a child walking along a beach. Geoff Burton’s cinematography (he also shot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/18/the-sum-of-us-rewatched-a-loving-father-a-gay-son\">The Sum of Us</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/oct/17/hotel-sorrento-rewatched-highfalutin-soap-opera-based-on-the-play\">Hotel Sorrento</a>) avoids the heavy, orange, sunburnt look so common in Australian films set among beaches or in the desert. The season looks more like autumn than summer, helping establish a sense of melancholy important to Storm Boy’s mood and energy.</p> <p>The boy, Mike aka Storm Boy (Greg Rowe) takes home an artefact collected from the sand. But his father Tom (Peter Cummins) instructs him to throw away the strange contraption (a personal radio), while in the small ramshackle hut they share. “The radio will tell you that you need this and that and a thousand other things,” he says. Tom’s cynicism has a back story, of course, which he will eventually be forced to reassess for the sake of his child.</p> <p>When we see Mike out in the wetlands by himself he is on a makeshift raft with a makeshift paddle, drifting among the reeds. The way Safran constructs the scene reflects the beauty of the water, which looks like a softly shimmering blanket, small waves moving with the ebb and flow of the film’s editing.</p> <p>Mike heads towards a small fire burning on an island, where he meets Fingerbone (David Gulpilil). This is one of two friendships core to the film; the other involves a pelican named Mr Percival. After discovering men have been shooting at the birds, Mike pledges to adopt three of them and his father grudgingly agrees. When they are raised to health they are set free but Mr Pervical refuses to leave, flapping about, following Mike, pointing his long snoz in the direction of people rather than the water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lrPnKEx7to\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lrPnKEx7to?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Thus begins probably the most loving portrait of a human being’s relationship with a pelican in cinema history. Granted, it’s not a burgeoning genre, but Storm Boy is right up there with the most affecting family films involving animals. It is also a drama deeply attuned to its own aesthetic. When Tom says “there’s a storm brewing” the film wants us to interpret the line as more than an assessment of the weather. The film’s colour palette darkens to reflect a more sombre state of play as the story progresses. </p> <p>Twenty minutes in, Gulpilil, in traditional Aboriginal bodypaint, recites a spiritual story about pelicans. Safran cuts to shots of the birds, waves crashing up against rocks, then back to the always entrancing Indigenous actor, now dancing on the sand. Later, during one of the film’s unforgettable scenes – a Willy-esque moment, but minus the super serve of cheese – Percival saves the lives of four sailors stuck in rocky waters.</p> <p>Saying goodbye to Mr Percival, or at least acknowledging he won’t be around forever, becomes a metaphor for Mike growing up and transitioning from the simple wonder of childhood to a world of greys and complications. When Gulpilil says the final, Circle of Life-esque line – “bird like him, never die” – it’s such a wonderful moment. </p> <p>The three key (human) performances are wonderful but Percival steals the show. In many ways this plucky and precious pelican is the core of the film. In addition to performing a primitive version of tag (mostly just him running) Percival has a bunch of tricks tucked up his wings, including the ability to catch balls and return them. God knows how they trained a pelican to do all this. </p> <p>We do know the real Mr Percival, who had been living in Adelaide Zoo since the late-1980s, passed away in 2009. “He was quite willing to

Fortunately, this mockumentary from New Zealand succeeds in being both: in fact, it’s the best comedy of the year. What We Do in the Shadows is directed by its stars Jemaine “Flight of the Conchords” Clement and Taika Waititi, who in 2005 was Oscar-nominated for his short film Two Cars, One Night. A group of vampires share a house in Wellington, squabbling about the washing up and facing off with a rival gang of werewolves, à la Twilight. The rigour with which their hideous and crepuscular world is imagined, combined with the continuous flow of top-quality gags, makes this a treat from first to last. After a while, I was embarrassed at myself for giggling so much. Our heroes are undead gentlemen from central Europe who have escaped problems and heartache in the old country to live in New Zealand. They bite a faintly annoying guy, who duly turns into a vampire and wants to hang out with them, and he brings along his best mate, a really nice non-vampire human bloke called Stu: all the vampires get a bromance crush, holding back from biting him and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc507vq07Iw\">he is the Bella Swan of this story</a>. But this film reminded me of something else: it is the comedy version of Abel Ferrara’s 1995 The Addiction. I can’t say fairer than that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

enters its final franchise furlong:</a> the third novel has been split and doubled like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, though not tripled like the Hobbit. Perhaps unexpectedly, the story of Katniss Everdeen still has energy and internal coherence. It seems to be on the point of evolving away from young adult drama towards superheroism, as if the whole thing has been a huge origin myth, showing Katniss becoming Mockingjay, a sleek, black-robed ninja with a quiver of deadly arrows, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/26/avengers-assemble-review\" title=\"\">Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye from the Avengers</a>. Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has now been persuaded by the rebellious districts to be the inspiring “Mockingjay” figurehead for their fightback against tyrannical President Snow (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/19/donald-sutherland-hunger-games-catching-fire\" title=\"\">Donald Sutherland</a>) who has captured Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and is forcing him to take part in bizarre propaganda interviews, disavowing his rebel comrades, though Katniss sees he has been brainwashed. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is the calculating PR chief Plutarch Heavensbee, another character with a name out of a strange Edwardian novel. The film plays on our real-world experience of warzone reporting, news management and spin. The Hunger Games is declining in power, but not as steeply as I thought, and this weird, operatic nightmare still inhabits the screen with confidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

imperialism’</a>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Tommy Lee Jones’s terrifically confident frontier western has inspired a variety of responses since its first appearance at festivals earlier this year. It has been suspected of misogyny – and then defended as feminist. Neither is quite accurate, although ideological responses have probably been amplified by critical shock at a certain late-breaking narrative development. The performances are great. Director Jones also stars as George Briggs, and awards himself plenty of closeups and big scenes. Briggs is a boozy, ornery old devil in mid-19th-century Nebraska. He fatefully encounters Mary Bee Cuddy: a respectable, courageous and heartbreakingly lonely unmarried woman superbly played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/18/hilary-swank-male-actors-earn-10-times-more-than-female\">Hilary Swank</a>. Like the decent woman that she is, Mary Bee has volunteered for the grim job of caring for three women who have suffered nervous breakdowns through the desolate hardship of their frontier lives, and she must now escort them back East to Ohio, chained up like prisoners in a wagon: a metaphor on wheels for the depression and madness that is all about. She chivvies reprobate Briggs into helping her in this journey, and by and by, their tense relationship begins to thaw. All this is, of course, not so far from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/10/true-grit-review\">True Grit</a>, or classics such as Stagecoach or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/14/russellcrowe.actionandadventure\">3:10 to Yuma</a>, or indeed Jones’s own much-admired previous directorial venture, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/02/philipfrench9\">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a>.The Homesman is based on a novel by Glendon Swarthout, whose The Shootist was filmed in 1976, with John Wayne in his final role.) It is a muscular, heartfelt picture, tempered with shrewd sympathy and insight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

Actually, it’s a thoughtful emotional drama, written and directed by the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnudu56ZaXg\" title=\"\">veteran playwright Israel Horovitz</a>. The film is a bit sentimental here and there, but well-acted, and when the cinemas are so full of YA, it’s interesting to get some A: a film for grownups. Kevin Kline plays recovering alcoholic Mathias, who shows up in Paris, having been left a handsome apartment by his father; embittered by failures and disappointments, he is relying on this property to boost his self-esteem. But to his horror, he finds it is a viager: it has a sitting tenant – who sold it for a song on condition that she can stay and receive rent for the rest of her life. This is the 92-year-old Mathilde (Maggie Smith) who regards Mathias with polite, queenly tolerance, though her daughter Chloé (Kristin Scott Thomas) is more disdainful. It is perhaps not too hard to guess the narrative direction of this ménage à trois, but there are ingenious twists along the way and the performances make it watchable. A soft-centred piece of movie confectionery, not without charm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck35r6E4VRM\"

Sadly, writer-producer Jez Butterworth and director Tate Taylor (The Help) stick to old cliches with this movie about James Brown, the legendary godfather of soul, and the music-biopic formula is tested to destruction and beyond. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/18/get-on-up-chadwick-boseman-james-brown-video-interview\">Chadwick Boseman’s portrayal of Brown</a> is strong and the movie certainly delivers some big songs. But its “jukebox” narrative style flashes back and forth between glibly mythologised scenes of Brown’s childhood and adulthood, which could frankly have come from many other films. And the dark episodes – Brown terrifying people with guns, beating his wife – are treated by this film as instantly forgivable and forgettable aberrations from an adorable, quirky personality. The film never gets below the surface. In particular, the all-important adult reunion with his mother is muddled and fractured. The music gives you some big, sugar-rush moments, but it’s a disappointing response to one of pop culture’s most brilliant and complicated figures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\"

Big mistake. In theory, it should be interesting to see Idris Elba back to playing a meaty bad-guy role, but this dumb exploitation flick is wince-inducingly awful, topped off with a truly ridiculous twist. Elba plays Colin, who is doing time for manslaughter: a preposterous exposition scene has a radio newsreader helpfully explaining the backstory. He escapes from the prison van transporting him from where his parole hearing was held, and effectively resumes the psychopathic, misogynist campaign of violence that got him banged up in the first place. This clunkingly terrible film is a baffling career move for Elba, and a waste of co-star Taraji P Henson.</p>","headline":"No Good Deed review – no redeeming features","trailText":"This preposterous exploitation flick is a baffling career move for Idris Elba, writes <strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/19/1416415262902/Idris-Elba-Idris-Elba-006.jpg","wordcount":"135","commentable":"true","starRating":"1","byline":"Peter Bradshaw","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-19T16:25:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/no-good-deed-review-idris-elba","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/20/no-good-deed-review-idris-elba","tags":[{"id":"film/crime","webTitle":"Crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/crime","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/crime","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/idris-elba","webTitle":"Idris Elba","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/idris-elba","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/idris-elba","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterbradshaw","webTitle":"Peter Bradshaw","rcsId":"GNL378000","r2ContributorId":"16262","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749338256/PeterBradshaw.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png","firstName":"","lastName":"bradshaw","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Bradshaw is the Guardian's film critic.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbradshaw","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/peterbradshaw","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/film-and-music","webTitle":"Film and music","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"e2d4c389c3c182ed79cc15e0bebde044a88944a4","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/19/1416415269345/Idris-Elba-Idris-Elba-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© 2014 Screen Gems Productions, Inc.

The constant wash of meta-commentary and a tone cantilevered just off realism adds a Godardian feel – he is name-checked – and there is a Jules et Jim-ish love triangle. But if this is a nouvelle vague for web 2.0, it proves surprisingly earnest. Mary’s self-conscious (and slightly irritating) escapades – buying a jellyfish online, an exploding iPhone – are subsumed into a more pained plotstream that mostly justifies an unTwitterishly elongated runtime.

film-maker who gave cinema one of its greatest hanging endings lauded as true visionary","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Directors and stars of Hollywood have spoken of their sadness after the death of Mike Nichols, the German-born renaissance man of American entertainment, at the age of 83.</p> <p>The director, best known for his 1967 classic The Graduate, died from a heart attack. ABC News president James Goldston, who announced his death, described Nichols as “a true visionary”, adding: “No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike. In a triumphant career that spanned over six decades, Mike created some of the most iconic works of American film, television and theatre.”</p> <p>Nichols won the best director Oscar for The Graduate, although his cabinet also contained a Golden Globe, a Grammy, four Emmys and nine Tony awards, making him one of a handful of people with all four major accolades to his name.</p> <p>His career embraced comedy and drama and straddled film, TV and theatre – the immigrant auteur seemed at home in every discipline. Nichols was married for more than 25 years to ABC anchor Diane Sawyer after they met in a Paris airport while awaiting a Concorde flight.</p> <p>News of his death prompted an outpouring of grief from figures across film and theatre, with actor Ben Stiller saying Nichols was “one of the best filmmakers and stage directors ever”.</p> <p>Meryl Streep, who worked with Nichols on Silkwood, Heartburn and Angels in America, and starred in his upcoming HBO film adaptation of Master Class, the Terrence McNally play about opera star Maria Callas, said Nichols was “an inspiration and joy to know, a director who cried when he laughed, a friend without whom, well, we can’t imagine our world, an indelible irreplaceable man”.</p> <p>Kevin Spacey, who appeared in Nichols’s 1988 film Working Girl, also paid tribute to the director who gave him his break into film. “Mike Nichols gave me my start,” he wrote. “A mentor, friend, colleague. One of the best observers of life. My thoughts are with Diane and his children.”</p> <p>His words were echoed by Mia Farrow, who described Nichols as the “funniest, smartest, most generous, wisest, kindest of all. Mike Nichols, a truly good man”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01535c0d39d716611aee67bb31645492189f2655\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416517892858/3f1d2c1c-16c1-4c5b-a76c-8e62364611e7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nichols with his wife, the broadcaster Diane Sawyer, pictured in 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichols with his wife, the broadcaster Diane Sawyer, pictured in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nancy Kaszerman//Zuma Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steven Spielberg said his death was a “seismic loss”. He added: “Mike was a friend, a muse, a mentor, one of America’s all-time greatest film and stage directors, and one of the most generous people I have ever known. For me, The Graduate was life-altering – both as an experience at the movies as well as a master class about how to stage a scene.</p> <p>“Mike had a brilliant cinematic eye and uncanny hearing for keeping scenes ironic and real. Actors never gave him less than their personal best – and then Mike would get from them even more. And in a room full of people, Mike was always the centre of gravity.”</p> <p>Born Mikhail Igor Peschowski into an artistic family in Berlin, Nichols fled to the US in 1939. He first worked in an improv troupe and found early fame in the 1950s as part of a comedy duo with Elaine May, peppering the audience with such quickfire repartee that the pair became known as “the world’s fastest humans”.</p> <p>Nichols made his film-directing debut with the scabrous Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1966, starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as a warring married couple. He went on to further acclaim with The Graduate, a film that perfectly caught the uneasy, questioning mood of late-60s America.</p> <p>It opened to the strains of Simon and Garfunkel’s The Sound of Silence and bowed out with Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross’s bus ride into the unknown – a final shot which remains one of cinema’s greatest hanging endings.</p> <p>“There is no piece of casting in the 20th century that I know of that is more courageous than putting me in that part,” Hoffman told The New Yorker in 2000.</p> <p>Nichols’s extensive body of work includes Carnal Knowledge (1971), which caused a scandal due to its sexually explicit content. The manager of a theatre in Georgia was arrested for showing the film and had to take his case to the US supreme court before being exonerated.</p> <p>Nichols’s other notable films include Silkwood, The Birdcage, Heartburn and Working Girl, and in 2004 he directed Closer, which saw its stars Clive Owen and Natalie Portman nominated for supporting actor Oscars. His directing swansong was the 2007 political farce Charlie Wilson’s War, starring Tom Hanks as a rogue congressman.</p> <p>“A movie is like a person,” Nichols once remarked. “Either you trust it or you don’t.”</p>","headline":"Here’s to you, Mike Nichols: tributes flow after death of Graduate director","trailText":"Oscar-winning film-maker who gave cinema one of its greatest hanging endings lauded as true visionary","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416517474760/Mike-Nichols-directing-Du-006.jpg","wordcount":"764","commentable":"false","byline":"Xan Brooks and Hannah Ellis-Petersen","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-23T21:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols-tributes-director-death-graduate","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols-tributes-director-death-graduate","tags":[{"id":"film/mike-nichols","webTitle":"Mike Nichols","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mike-nichols","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mike-nichols","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/xanbrooks","webTitle":"Xan Brooks","rcsId":"GNL340208","r2ContributorId":"16580","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/24/1403601038971/Xan-Brooks-003.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399296989428/Xan-Brooks-R.png","firstName":"xan","lastName":"brooks","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Xan Brooks is associate editor of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/xanbrooks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/xanbrooks","references":[]},{"id":"profile/hannah-ellis-petersen","webTitle":"Hannah Ellis-Petersen","r2ContributorId":"62979","firstName":"hannah","lastName":"ellis-petersen","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Hannah Ellis-Petersen is the Guardian's culture reporter.

In the evening, the rain came and he <a href=\"http://i2.cdnds.net/14/36/618x489/showbiz-bill-murray-1.jpg\">squelched down the red carpet</a> for the premiere of his new movie, St Vincent. As the credits rolled and the audience stood, he took to the stage in <a href=\"http://i2.cdnds.net/14/36/618x681/showbiz-bill-murray-3.jpg\">plastic crown and beauty queen sash and still-sodden suit</a>. </p> <p>Thing is: if you’re Bill Murray, every day is Bill Murray Day. Every day a Groundhog Day of being treated like a deity. Every morning brings people if not actually wearing your face, then with your features engraved on their hearts. St Vincent’s director, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0577647/reference\">Theodore Melfi</a>, tells me of a time at Atlanta airport when a stranger ran up to Murray and told him how much she loved him. He told her he loved her too and kissed her – hard, on the lips. “It made her life.” Of the waiter in New York who carried around the $50 note Murray once gave him to enrol in an acting class. This is a man whose visitations – <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2640920/Twice-divorced-Bill-Murray-crashes-bachelors-party-gives-marriage-advice-hoisting-groom-shoulder.html\">crashing a stag do here</a>, <a href=\"http://thechive.com/2011/01/05/what-if-bill-murray-just-showed-up-in-your-karaoke-room-9-photo-exclusive/\">rocking the karaoke there</a> – are taken as elusive proof of his divinity. If God was one of us, the logic goes, he’d be Bill Murray.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b7ad3915-f089-4d5e-8b3a-a709373f71c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504233369/8a12237e-90d2-41af-bd0a-e527be7ad3d6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray in Cannes in 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray at Cannes in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominique Charriau/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Official meetings are correspondingly sacrosanct. I’m allotted 10 minutes, stretched to 15 with begging, then 20 through undignified stalling when the publicist comes to fetch me. No more is possible. Off the promo trail, he’s absolutely unavailable – no agent, no manager, no point of contact other than <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/guide-to-calling-bill-murrays-1-800-number.html\">an unlisted 1-800 number</a> on which you can leave a voicemail. I ask Melfi if he might like to share it with me. He laughs.</p> <p>I wait on a deserted floor at the <a href=\"http://www.trumphotelcollection.com/toronto/\">Trump hotel</a>, sandwiched between two packed ones. The hallowed atmosphere intensifies. After a time, a security guard materialises and discusses the carpet. Then he touches his ear. “Your parcel has arrived,” he says and evaporates. Murray strolls round the corner.</p> <p>“Well, you look delightful,” he says. “And you smell nice.” He’s wearing blue linen and is very tall. His silver hair is blond at the tips, so when he gives a gummy grin, you think of the <a href=\"http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111117164139/telletubbies/images/e/eb/The_Sun.jpg\">baby in the sun on Teletubbies</a>. Later, Tilda Swinton says she thinks he has the look of “a tired child who has laughed so much he aches – but finds it too complicated to fully explain the joke”. That’s true. It’s like talking to a crumpled bag of sweets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b6f547d4-61cb-4832-87db-2b4a5bc2fbcd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504497279/3f74b2a6-c07c-426a-835e-60761beecf44-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray and Saoirse Ronan in Berlin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray and Saoirse Ronan at the Berlin premiere of Moonrise Kingdom, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Teuchmann/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We’re shown to a room and I help him read the Coke bottle label (he only drinks Mexican, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/mexican-coke-is-ditching-cane-sugar-for-high-fructose-c-1459437477\">on account of the corn syrup</a>). We inspect the facilities. He suggests we take a bath or watch a DVD. Four hardboiled eggs and some fried potatoes are ushered in. He doesn’t touch them.</p> <p>I have quarter of an hour left. How did he find Bill Murray Day? “OK. Daunting. I was sort of dreading it, I thought it would be so embarrassing. But people seemed to think it was as funny as I did. It was just as good as having a birthday and a great cake and fireworks.” He thinks more. “It was a good day.”</p> <p>So why do people place such faith in actors? Because what they do seems miraculous? Sure, he says. For him, too. “It’s always a question for me: how are people pulling this off? How can they live with it, how they can be that person up on a screen and then walk down a street or go to a grocery store or drive a car or have a conversation. Like: how does that happen? Where do you get to be superhuman? How can you do it?</p> <p>“People identify with that. They think: I’d love to be Superman for a while, or be the guy who’s being funny and not taking any guff. I wish I could say that to my neighbour or my wife. You’d like to have that kind of freedom. You go: yeah, that’s what you’re supposed to do. That’s what a hero does.”</p> <p>In St Vincent, Murray is a familiar kind of hero: the lovable gruff, the mensch in grouchclothing. Vincent is a rude boozer who bets on the horses and has got a Russian prostitute (Naomi Watts) pregnant. He’s mean to new neighbour, single mum Melissa McCarthy. But then he starts babysitting her lonesome son and we twig: he’s great, under the grump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duZJnlpnmCQ\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/duZJnlpnmCQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The movie plays out like Murray’s greatest hits. He sings slurrily and dances funny, cracks wise and rolls his eyes, a dignified clown, brimful of feeling even at his most brittle. Melfi <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/entertainment/2014/10/16/how-bill-murray-got-cast-vincent/DrIjJ8PuGbDFTay6yyGRJJ/story.html\">originally courted Jack Nicholson</a>, but when he passed, Murray said he was interested, if he could tailor the script to his strengths.</p> <p>And Vincent’s emotional journey follows the same arc as Murray’s characters in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/groundhog-day-perfect-comedy-for-ever\">Groundhog Day</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters\">Ghostbusters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/106026/broken.flowers\">Broken Flowers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96936/lost.in.translation\">Lost in Translation</a>. He gets domesticated. The curmudgeon finds salvation in conventionality. “Vincent has got to acknowledge,” says Murray, “that we all have an obligation to more than just ourselves. In this world it plays out as our fellow man. And ultimately something higher – that’s the ultimate we manifest. But the tasks we’re given here are our families.”</p> <p>Yet Murray’s root appeal is not based on this third-act incarnation. Movies may need to end that way, but off-screen, the closer to average Murray gets, the less we want to be like him. It’s the frank and freewheeling real-life guy we worship, the one who rollicks about dressed like a jumble sale, whose irreverence hasn’t been curbed.</p> <p>So why does he connect quite so deeply? Cameron Crowe, who’s just finished shooting a movie with him, thinks Murray’s detachment from the star system alters his affinity with an audience. Like the new pope, he walks among us. “He’s very skilled at breaking through the barriers that make many celebrities so uncomfortable around their fans. With Bill and his fans it’s an equal playing field. He’s not floating above them in some hallowed showbiz world, he’s right there with them, living life, like the big brother or uncle you look forward to seeing at Christmas. He doesn’t live in a gilded cage and run from his fans, he runs with them. I think he’s even done that – literally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12c35bf9200d386bdd7e058c08098f1d4d1f4cc8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504381530/a06928fb-f7c4-4a02-a94e-1fef2f7f07b9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray at the Ryder Cup in 2012\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray at the Ryder Cup, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ERIK S. LESSER/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“His fame is a fluid, growing thing. Being a fan of Bill Murray never gets boring because he’s not bored, he’s more mercurial and yet somehow more available than ever. In a world where most careers are xeroxes of each other, his is uniquely his own.”</p> <p>For Melfi and Swinton, Murray’s joie de vivre is key. Swinton recalls him larking about with her children on the set of Broken Flowers, partying the night away with the 12-year-old cast of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article7758123.ece/alternates/w620/Pg-06-Moonrise-Kingdom-ap.jpg\">Moonrise Kingdom in Cannes</a>. He has, she says, “a kind of hopeful aspect; maybe only a trick of the light or something about his look that suggests a constant readiness to play. The sense that no foolishness you could ever admit would faze him. The impression of knowing where the best fun can be found at all times.”</p> <p>“From zero to 12,” says Melfi, “we were all doing what we wanted to. As we get older we start getting reservations. We live by society’s code of rules – that’s acceptable and that’s not. Bill doesn’t. He lives his life with a complete joy and freedom. And I would desperately love to say: fuck it I’m not going to work today, I’m going to see this band I like. Or I’m just gonna jump on this train real quick, go to Philadelphia and have a cheese steak.”</p> <p>It’s only Harvey Weinstein – who’s distributing St Vincent in the US – who suggests this could come with a kick. <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/bill-murray-st-vincent-1201328900/\">Speaking to Variety</a> about being a “born-again Murray-ite”, he said: “It’s a religion, where you can act as badly as you want to people, and they still love you. I used to feel guilty about behaving badly, and I met Bill, and it feels so much better.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-59daef5e-9071-4ea6-857b-48cd4febb4a1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504713528/57cfb981-8617-47d9-835b-0245ef22b307-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray in Broken Flowers, 2005\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broken Flowers, 2005</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Murray has licence, almost immunity. He’s Teflon in the face of anything even <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11086967/Bill-Murray-the-more-relaxed-you-are-the-better-you-are.html\">vaguely unsavoury</a> (it’s interesting that in his films he’s often a lothario, but passive, not predatory; more often seduced than seducing). “He has a certain rare animal – snow leopard – quality,” says Swinton. “Kinda dangerous as well as exotic.”</p> <p>Murray was born in the mid-20th century, the middle child of nine, living in a three-bedroom house in Chicago. Before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awjxul278bo\">Second City</a>, before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03vT72PsSeE\">Saturday Night Live</a>, his improv skills were honed round the dining table. Younger brother Joel has said that the aim was to make their father – a slow eater – laugh with his mouth full. (Murray himself has six sons, by a couple of ex-wives, and his conversation sometimes gets snagged on custody.)</p> <p>His parents were Irish Catholics; one of his sisters is a nun. This conspicuous religion adds to his broad church appeal (there’s a citation from the Christian Science Monitor on his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cinderella-Story-My-Life-Golf/dp/0767905229\">golfing memoirs</a>). You don’t need to ask if his faith is important to him. He talks about how 19th-century candidates risk not getting canonised because the church is keen to push ahead with the likes of John Paul II and Mother Teresa. “I think they’re just trying to get current and hot,” he smiles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e247275e4e2e705f6cb1766de48c9aace3c18835\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416493669298/8fa87a47-48f5-4c8c-9442-295c55618905-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saturday Night Live, 1977.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saturday Night Live, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One new saint he does approve of is <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Pope+John+XXI&amp;oq=Pope+John+XXI&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.335j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Pope+John+XXIII&amp;spell=1\">Pope John XXIII</a> (who died in 1963). “I’ll buy that one, he’s my guy; an extraordinary joyous Florentine who changed the order. I’m not sure all those changes were right. I tend to disagree with what they call the new mass. I think we lost something by losing the Latin. Now if you go to a Catholic mass even just in Harlem it can be in Spanish, it can be in Ethiopian, it can be in any number of languages. The shape of it, the pictures, are the same but the words aren’t the same.”</p> <p>Isn’t it good for people to understand it? “I guess,” he says, shaking his head. “But there’s a vibration to those words. If you’ve been in the business long enough you know what they mean anyway. And I really miss the music – the power of it, y’know? Yikes! Sacred music has an affect on your brain.” Instead, he says, we get “folk songs … top 40 stuff … oh, brother….”</p> <p>Murray is loved for being carefree. But face to face he can seem not just serious, but sober, even sensible. People may tweet when he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwwEGjGbxXM\">turns up to serve tequila</a>, but I suspect he also spends quite a lot of time quietly reading the paper. Melfi calls him a “deep thinker” who’s gifted him a lot of books about parenting. And today what really fires him up turns out to be seatbelt safety. In particular the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_legislation\">1965 legislation</a> making them compulsory in new cars. For this, he thinks Ralph Nader is “the greatest living American”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f85feae1-0040-4e69-9291-aff95b89ab91\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504314668/338f5975-acb2-4809-a3dc-ed1dae0464f8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray in his new movie St. Vincent\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Vincent, 2014</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“People thought: ‘Why is this son of a gun making me wear a seatbelt?’ Well, in 1965 I think the number was 55,000 deaths on the highway a year. That’s a lot of people dying. So he’s saved just about a couple of million people by now. It’s crazy! And that’s just one thing he did!</p> <p>“I mean, they made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/schindler-s-list\">a movie</a> about<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler\"> the German who smuggled the Jews out</a>. He saved hundreds. Great man. Deserved a movie. Spectacular. Great film and a great human being. But this guy, Ralph – there’s no movies about Ralph.”</p> <p>His eyes catch light and he leans forward. He could sing Nader’s praises for ever, and starts to try.</p> <p>“Businesses bitch about this guy and people hate him because he’s trying to make change. He hasn’t become like super-crazy-wealthy or anything and it’s not about his celebrity. He’s really interested in improving the quality of life for the whole world. Not just America the entire world.”</p> <p>Was he sorry Nader never made president? No, he was depressed that people blamed him for diverting Democrat votes in 2000, leading to Bush’s victory. “You know: that’s Al Gore’s fault! We didn’t all come here to make the world easier for Al Gore. He should have run a better campaign. He ran a lousy campaign. He was the vice-president during the greatest economic boom in the history of the country.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-df5a0509-8fa8-4bb0-86fc-4b9df3d92628\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504851521/21fd202d-8183-4703-957b-47ebb8437c7e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Groundhog Day, 1993\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groundhog Day, 1993</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He shakes his head, sadly. “Political parties work to cripple their opponents. They spend all their time in office trying to paralyse the work of the others. They try to stifle. It’s cruel, cruel.”</p> <p>The PR is back and my time is up. So: how might things change in the future, I say, gathering my bag slowly.</p> <p>“Well, eventually something horrible will happen, something dynamic and powerful.

Yet the vibe of a casino (especially an illegal one in a gated mansion or in labyrinthine Koreatown basement) certainly has its allure. An unexpected shade of Rupert Wyatt’s The Gambler – and it’s felt even more here than in Karel Reisz’s 1974 version starring James Caan – is that Mark Wahlberg’s Jim Bennett has precious little lust for the typical high-rollers’ lifestyle. Any thrills felt when the cards turn in Bennett’s favour, as they do on occasion, is on you. This is not about the rush of addiction. Jim Bennett is a man on a mission: he has to get down to nothing, so that maybe he can build himself back up. That is, if he’s still alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"928c745b4478cc77e3d82d1d84a37043623df647\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416500692461/d2e19baa-e8bb-409a-b318-fdb1c66f1346-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Gambler Mark Wahlberg\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">School’s out: Mark Wahlberg in The Gambler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Folger/Allstar/Paramount Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the film’s title, Bennett frequently reminds us that he isn’t a gambler. Maybe he’s suicidal, or maybe he’s just a whiny rich brat. But he hates himself, coming as he does from wealth, privilege and education. By day he’s a college literature professor, browbeating his students with nihilism. Screenwriter William Monahan gifts Wahlberg with cement blocks of text about the pains of mediocrity. There are three in his class who know of his life outside of the lecture hall. One is an ace tennis player Dexter (Emory Cohen) who tutors Bennett’s millionaire mother (Jessica Lange). Another is working-class Amy (Brie Larson), a waitress at an underground gambling parlour, who Bennett claims is the only one in the whole school including himself who can write worth a damn. Finally, there is a Lamar (Anthony Kelley), the star basketball player whose seeming lack of interest in literature leads to a friendship that may offer Bennett his only chance at survival.</p> <p>Mirroring this triumvirate are three different men who smell blood in Bennett’s desperation. He owes more than $200,000 to the gambling ring owned by Mr Lee (Alvin Ing), a medium-sized grifter (Michael Kenneth Williams) and a beast of a loanshark played by John Goodman. We first meet Goodman’s Frank in a Grecian bathhouse, blubber spilling out from beneath his robes as he barks a cruel economic philosophy that, when you set aside all the profanity, actually makes a great deal of sense. He’s the most frightening character in a film full of gangsters, but he’s the only one offering advice. Despite his bluster, he seems to care a little bit about Bennett, the grandson of an industrialist from an age of unrivalled American exceptionalism. Goodman’s extended cameo can sit alongside Ned Beatty’s in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/\">Network</a>, and his scenes are some of the most exhilarating you’ll see in a movie this year.</p> <p>The film is framed with a ticking clock, but does Bennett even want to get out of his hole and pay these men back? Somewhere in the chunky monologues and all-over-the-map music cues there’s the understanding that what Bennett really wants is to call their collective bluffs. They come to realise that threatening him or his family won’t get any traction, but they may get some movement threatening his new friends, particularly Amy. Sure, it’s a little obvious to present the love of a good (and young and brilliant) woman as the reason to give up a death wish, but pretty much everything in The Gambler is meant to be seen as big and metaphorical; there’s an entire sequence devoted to discussing Albert Camus’s The Stranger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gPQXbFs9Y\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5gPQXbFs9Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>If it weren’t for Wahlberg’s dynamite performance and the strangeness of the dialogue, The Gambler would have you muttering: “You jerk, just OD on sleeping pills and shaddap already!” And it would surely be more noble to donate the family money to Médecins Sans Frontières instead of busting at 21. But there’s the undeniable romance (and cinematic virtue) of having an entire film come down to one roll of the dice while the vultures circle above. This spiral of self-imposed despair feels like part three of a trilogy of American financial darkness after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146643/killing-them-softly\">Killing Them Softly</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-counsellor\">The Counsellor</a>. The Gambler isn’t quite so audience-unfriendly, but those looking for a typical Wahlberg thriller might come away disappointed. Others looking for a less sure bet might reap the rewards.</p>","headline":"The Gambler review – Mark Wahlberg gives a dynamite display of self-hatred","trailText":"Rupert Wyatt’s version of this spiral of self-imposed despair isn’t a typical thriller but offers surefire cinematic – if not moral – virtue, writes <strong>Jordan Hoffman</strong><br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495712709/Mark-Wahlberg-and-Brie-La-004.jpg","wordcount":"737","commentable":"true","starRating":"4","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-20T23:59:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/gambler-film-review-mark-wahlberg-dynamite-selfhatred","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/20/gambler-film-review-mark-wahlberg-dynamite-selfhatred","tags":[{"id":"film/series/first-look-review","webTitle":"First look review","description":"Early reviews from film festivals and advance previews","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/first-look-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/first-look-review","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/mark-wahlberg","webTitle":"Mark Wahlberg","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-wahlberg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mark-wahlberg","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

In the same period, the UK has produced just one – the low-budget The Patrol. Next week, we receive No 2: the tough, gruelling Kajaki, a recreation of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/17/chinook-inquest-military-afghanistan\">lethal real-life 2006 incident</a> in which a group of paratroopers were trapped in a minefield, named after the region in Helmand province where it occurred.</p> <p>Kajaki is a fascinating, revealing artefact, whether or not you find its actual content – a visceral, empathethic study of the British military – of interest. One of the tiny band of non-second-world-war British war films, it has clearly been financed outside mainstream channels – no TV or BFI money here – and has chosen to go its own way with its distribution, having set up an exclusive deal with the Vue cinema chain and funnelling money back to military charities. It has also swerved clear of openly grappling with the thorny political issues that have surrounded the Afghan war – and its related conflict in Iraq – since its inception.</p> <p>Kajaki is not a combat film per se: the courage and heroism on display don’t derive from engagement with the Taliban, but rather a gruesome blunder in to a minefield left over from the Soviet invasion. Kajaki’s executive producer Gareth Ellis-Unwin – best known as one of the producers of The King’s Speech – says Kajaki is “politically agnostic”: although one man lost his life, and several more were grievously injured, it’s a story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/09/military.nato\">procedural cockup and red-tape </a>as much as anything else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01dcd1ab3ec6df01badf8cd00c793bf7f562f033\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495337243/a33df29d-7770-49de-8425-03bdf0f8fbc6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lone Survivor.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lone Survivor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Katis, Kajaki’s director, suggests that in this respect the film is truer to “the nature of war”. During his research, he says, he asked about medals: “How many were for a chosen, planned action, and how many for things going wrong?” The “informal” feedback was that “80%-90%” were given in connection with the latter.</p> <p>Films about the Afghan and Iraq wars will inevitably trigger outraged responses – and not just from Guardian readers. But war films are a staple part of cinema, ranging from extreme, realist statements of radical intent – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-battle-of-algiers\">The Battle of Algiers</a>, <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/screen/story/0,6903,595331,00.html\">Land and Freedom</a> – to fantasies that try to rewrite history – Rambo, Red Dawn. Add in numerous combat documentaries on the one hand, and mythic sci-fi and pseudo-histories – Starship Troopers, Lord of the Rings, Ender’s Game, etc – on the other, and it’s clear we are never far from a war film of one kind or another.</p> <p>But approaching recent conflicts, where the wounds are fresh and the battlefields still active, is something that the British film industry has proved extremely reluctant to do, especially compared with its US counterparts. Probably the closest Hollywood equivalent to Kajaki is Lone Survivor, in which a four-man Navy Seal team is stranded behind enemy lines. Like Kajaki, it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/04/only-ones-sole-survivors-near-death\">based on a real incident</a>, though unlike Kajaki it includes copious combat sequences, with much dubious videogame-style footage along the American soldiers’ sightlines.</p> <p>Kajaki’s makers are anxious to highlight the differences between Hollywood films and theirs. Katis says he was struck by how averse to the trigger-happy antics of onscreen American soldiers the British troops he spoke to were. “That’s just not the British army way. I was told on a number of occasions: we don’t like being called heroes. We’re professional soldiers, just doing our jobs.”</p> <p>There is a wider issue, of course: the US’s superpower status, as opposed to the UK’s post-imperial hangover. Katis says: “We’ve been apologising since the 1960s for being the big boys. America is the new empire on the block, and they are happy to make films that reinforce it. You would expect them to be bullish about their troops.” But the point remains that Hollywood and the US armed forces are in a mutually supportive relationship that generates a supply of pro-military films that – the blip of Vietnam notwithstanding – has ensured that home support for US troops has rarely wavered.</p> <p>The situation in the UK is somewhat different. Katis describes a number of contacts with the army and the ministry of defence that can be characterised as “ambiguous” at best; he says they received plenty of help from individual servicemen but the MoD “got cold feet”. In fact, he says that the US department of defense was significantly more responsive, reading the script within 24 hours. “The MoD isn’t set up that way. They are the whipping boy and have a paranoid relationship with the media. I feel sorry for them, as much as you can for a government bureaucracy.”</p> <p>Be that as it may, Katis remains convinced there is an “institutional bias” in this country against films such as Kajaki, which applies to funding sources as much as Whitehall. However, it turns out to be a case of cut your cloth as you find it.</p> <p>“We couldn’t afford to do big action pieces, so we replaced action with tension. That’s why the story works. These young men are in this situation, and they have to discover the courage inside themselves. At the heart of it is: what would you do?”</p> <p><em>Kajaki is released on 28 November</em></p>","headline":"Why is Hollywood’s take on the Afghan conflict so different from the UK’s?","trailText":"Kajaki is a very British film about the Afghan war: tense without showing combat, it is the antithesis of Hollywood glory-gore. <strong>Andrew Pulver</strong> reports","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495218132/Thomas-Davison-in-Kajaki.-004.jpg","wordcount":"885","commentable":"true","byline":"Andrew Pulver","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-23T16:15:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks","tags":[{"id":"film/war-films","webTitle":"War films","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/war-films","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/war-films","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/lone-survivor","webTitle":"Lone Survivor","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lone-survivor","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/lone-survivor","references":[]},{"id":"film/zero-dark-thirty","webTitle":"Zero Dark Thirty","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/zero-dark-thirty","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/zero-dark-thirty","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andrewpulver","webTitle":"Andrew Pulver","rcsId":"GNL004602","r2ContributorId":"15370","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345733137119/AndrewPulver.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"pulver","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andrew Pulver is Film editor, guardian.co.uk</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewpulver","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/andrewpulver","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/film-and-music","webTitle":"Film and music","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"9434e3e53d3f86ec8e4450aaae0f8bbbcc8e72a6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495223453/Thomas-Davison-in-Kajaki.-009.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495223453/Thomas-Davison-in-Kajaki.-009.jpg","source":"PR ","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Thomas Davison in Kajaki.","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: PR ","caption":"Thomas Davison in Kajaki.

stage director whose movie The Graduate ushered in a new kind of male Hollywood star","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>The career of the director Mike Nichols, who has died aged 83, triumphantly straddled Broadway and Hollywood. Most of his movies, plays and musicals were thought-provoking and beautifully crafted, if sometimes ironic and even cruel in their humour. But none of his later work equalled the impact of his second film, The Graduate (1967), which won him the Oscar for best director, and resonated strongly with the baby-boom generation.</p> <p>When offered the film, Nichols had already made his reputation as the boy wonder of the Broadway stage, where he had directed a string of smash-hit comedies. Two were by Neil Simon, with whom he would have a long association: Barefoot in the Park (1963), which gave Robert Redford his first leading role, and The Odd Couple (1965), with Walter Matthau and Art Carney. Others included Murray Shisgal’s Luv (1964), starring Alan Arkin, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, and the musical The Apple Tree (1966), featuring Alan Alda. At the start of the decade he had established a reputation on Broadway in the comedy duo show that he wrote and performed with Elaine May.</p> <p>Born in Berlin as Michael Igor Peschkowsky to Paul, a doctor, and his wife, Brigitte (nee Landauer), he arrived in the US with his younger brother at the age of seven, having fled the Nazis. His father, who had arrived a few months earlier (Brigitte joined them after two years), changed the family’s name to Nichols. Mike remembered being able to say just two things in English: “I don’t speak English,” and “Please don’t kiss me.” At the time he was totally bald, having lost his hair in reaction to a whooping cough vaccine. (He wore a toupee all his life.)</p> <p>When he was 12, his father died of leukaemia, leaving the family financially destitute. A bright and ambitious boy, Mike was able to continue his studies thanks to scholarships and doing odd jobs, eventually becoming a US citizen in 1944.</p> <p>While at the University of Chicago (1950-53), he made a living as a night janitor, hotel desk clerk, and delivery truck driver. It was at university that he first began to perform, and he later went to New York to study acting with Lee Strasberg. However, he was unable to find work as an actor and returned to Chicago to form the Second City, an improvisational group with similarly unwanted performers: May, Barbara Harris and Arkin.</p> <p>He and May then formed the duo Nichols and May, whose quick-witted comedy got them known as “the world’s fastest humans”. They lampooned previously sacrosanct institutions, becoming part of the satire boom of the period, along with Lenny Bruce, Jules Feiffer, Mort Sahl and Terry Southern, pioneers in extending the range and subject matter of American comedy. The pair recorded a number of comedy albums, and won a Grammy for An Evening With Nichols and May, a recording of their Broadway show, directed by Arthur Penn (1961-62), after which the two went their separate ways, with Nichols embarking on his work as a stage director.</p> <p>In 1966, Ernest Lehman, who was producing and adapting Edward Albee’s acid drama of marital non-bliss, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, persuaded Warner Bros to hire Nichols to direct. It was a baptism of fire for the debutant film-maker, who had to control the leading couple, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. After the three less than convincing films they had previously made together, Virginia Woolf brilliantly restored their credibility as performers, and Nichols’s essentially theatrical but competent direction was nominated for an Oscar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbb26b6ebe7f4e0de47cbc10fa8f1ca3fa1f779f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416496414914/4eaf3851-db01-4ec9-84dd-03d7ab03a3fa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Nichols at the launch of Closer in Los Angeles in 2004.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Nichols at the launch of Closer in Los Angeles in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Prouser/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whereas on Virginia Woolf he had been constricted by the starry couple and the confines of the Albee play, Nichols had far more power to exercise on The Graduate. For the title role of Benjamin Braddock, the producers wanted Robert Redford. However, Nichols felt he was too dishy to be convincing as shy with women. He realised he had found the right man when he saw Dustin Hoffman acting off-Broadway. Hoffman was doubtful: “I don’t think I’m right for the role. He’s a kind of Anglo-Saxon, tall, slender good-looking chap. I’m short and Jewish.” “Believe me, Benjamin is Jewish inside,” replied Nichols persuasively. Hoffman turned out to be the movie’s greatest coup, ushering in a new kind of male actor in American films. Yet Hoffman was later to say, “If there is any victory in the film, it is not mine. It has nothing to do with me. The film belongs to Mike Nichols. Nichols knew every colour, texture and nuance he wanted and worked like hell to get it.”</p> <p>Today, it seems stranger than ever that a movie that made no reference to civil rights or Vietnam would be taken as a symbol of counterculture. “I was interested in [Benjamin’s] rejection of a materialistic life in a way that was a little retarded, like young teenagers do until they’re trained away from it,” Nichols commented years later.</p> <p>The skin-deep rebel had a great appeal among middle-class college kids, and the use of the Simon and Garfunkel songs Sounds of Silence, Mrs Robinson and the irrelevant Scarborough Fair, instead of the usual music score, added to the film’s attraction. The soundtrack album reached the top of the US charts, and arguably started the tradition of marketing movie music.</p> <p>The most telling symbol of the young man’s alienation, which Nichols lightens and makes funny, is Benjamin standing awkwardly in a rubber underwater suit. A subjective camera, filming through goggles, picks out the inane faces and soundless mouths of his elders as he descends to the bottom of the pool, where he stands silently and alone.</p> <p>Catch-22 (1969), which could possibly have worked if made by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-stanley-kubrick-1079329.html\" title=\"\">Stanley Kubrick</a>, was shot at a cost of $18m, and failed both commercially and critically. Nichols made the mistake of reshaping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/14/josephheller1\" title=\"\">Joseph Heller</a>’s bitterly satirical novel of the second world war into an overly arty anti-war movie with unsubtle allusions to Vietnam. Further film flops followed, although to their credit they were all rather quirky and unconventional: Carnal Knowledge (1971) examined contemporary sexual mores; Day of the Dolphin (1973) saw George C Scott teaching dolphins to speak; and The Fortune (1975) starred Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty as dumb and dumber crooks.</p> <p>Because of these disappointments, Nichols worked almost exclusively on Broadway for almost a decade, collecting a number of Tony awards on the way. He continued to show his affinity with Neil Simon, directing Plaza Suite (1968) and The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1972), as well as Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing (1984) and Ariel Dorfman’s Death and the Maiden (1986). One of the few classics was Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya, which Nichols himself translated.</p> <p>Silkwood (1983) was hailed as his major film comeback, but despite fine performances from Meryl Streep and an interesting decision to concentrate on the daily life of its blue-collar heroine, it ended at the point where the real story began. Similarly, Heartburn (1986) started from promising material – Nora Ephron’s fictionalised account of her marriage to the Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein – but took it nowhere.</p> <p>It was soon after that Nichols had a breakdown, believing that he was broke and unable to provide for his three children. He left The Last Tycoon during pre-production (Elia Kazan took over) and had a highly publicised on-set dispute with Robert De Niro on The Man Who Looked Like Bogie, abandoning it after several days of filming.</p> <p>However, after marrying his fourth wife, the TV anchor Diane Sawyer, one of the richest and most successful women on American television, in 1988, everything changed. He took on more mainstream material, starting with Biloxi Blues (1987), a pleasing, workmanlike transposition of Simon’s semi-autobiographical Broadway play.</p> <p>Working Girl (1988), in which he showed more cinematic flair than hitherto, combined a feelgood romantic comedy with an incisive look at working women in Manhattan, in which a secretary (Melanie Griffith) triumphs over her boss (Sigourney Weaver). As the camera celebrates her moment of victory – in her office – it pulls back to reveal her as just one of hundreds of office workers in just one of hundreds of tower blocks.</p> <p>Postcards from the Edge (1990), which dealt with the explosively difficult relationship between a self-obsessed Hollywood star (Shirley MacLaine) and her unstable daughter (Meryl Streep), was directed with a confident sweep. These films were concerned mainly with women’s choices, while the less successful Regarding Henry (1991) and Wolf (1994) were both attempts to examine masculinity in crisis as viewed from New York’s Upper West Side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07a5cbd991f4ac3868a8501e107769b2fca697a6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416496981580/13c660c2-3f0f-41f3-a6a5-5e56d7690ad9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Mike Nichols and Elaine May quick-fire comedy duo in 1958.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mike Nichols and Elaine May quick-fire comedy duo in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nichols returned to comedy and to Elaine May, who wrote the screenplay of The Bird Cage (1996), better made than and almost as funny as La Cage aux Folles, the 1978 camp French film from which it derived. Primary Colors (1998), also written by May, and based on Joe Klein’s bestseller about a Clintonesque politician (John Travolta), was sharp without cutting deeply.</p> <p>By now, Nichols could ask for $7m per movie plus a share of the gross. He had proved himself an astute businessman, having been the first American stage director to insist on a share of the author’s royalties and subsidiary rights, including movie profits.</p> <p>He continued to embark on theatrical ventures, appearing to acclaim in a London production of Wallace Shawn’s The Designated Mourner (1996), and expertly transposed several plays to television and film. Nichols made few attempts to open out Wit (2001), Margaret Edson’s original off-Broadway near-monologue play about an academic dying of ovarian cancer, with most of the action taking place around the heroine’s hospital bed, and Emma Thompson speaking directly to camera in theatrical fashion.</p> <p>Tony Kushner’s Angels in America (2003), described by the author as a “gay fantasia on national themes” was made into an intelligent TV mini-series, and Closer (2004), Patrick Marber’s unrelenting look at two couples who fall in and out of bed and love, showed some of the bite of Nichols’s earlier work. The eclectic director was back on Broadway with Spamalot (2005), a musical based on Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which later opened in London.</p> <p>His last feature film was Charlie Wilson’s War (2007), a controversial political comedy starring Tom Hanks as a wily US congressman who gets involved in the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. In 2012, Nichols crowned his Broadway career with a powerful production of Death of a Salesman, starring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/03/philip-seymour-hoffman\" title=\"\">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, in his last stage role, as Willy Loman.</p> <p>He is survived by Diane, and by three children: Daisy, with his second wife, Margo Callas, and Max and Jenny, with his third wife, Annabel Davis-Goff. His previous three marriages ended in divorce; the first was to Patricia Scott.</p> <p>• Mike Nichols (Michael Igor Peschkowsky), director, producer, writer and performer, born 6 November 1931; died 19 November 2014</p>","headline":"Mike Nichols obituary","trailText":"Film and stage director whose movie The Graduate ushered in a new kind of male Hollywood star","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495837177/The-Graduate-1970-003.jpg","wordcount":"1817","commentable":"true","byline":"Ronald Bergan","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-04T14:47:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols","tags":[{"id":"film/mike-nichols","webTitle":"Mike Nichols","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mike-nichols","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mike-nichols","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"stage/broadway","webTitle":"Broadway","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/broadway","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/stage/broadway","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ronaldbergan","webTitle":"Ronald Bergan","r2ContributorId":"25523","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/10/ronald_bergan_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"bergan","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ronaldbergan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ronaldbergan","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"53cde83b3ee8d7fdd7801043dfd8da3d0d3a0648","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495842492/The-Graduate-1970-008.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495842492/The-Graduate-1970-008.jpg","source":"Snap","photographer":"Rex","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"The Graduate (1970)","suppliersReference":"390912gc","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Rex/Snap","caption":"The Graduate (1967), directed by Mike Nichols, became a symbol of counterculture.

This film is avowedly inspired by Anton Chekhov, and since its appearance at this year’s Cannes film festival, critics have specifically identified in it Chekhov’s stories Excellent People (1886) and The Wife (1892), although in an interview with me, the director denied having intended or created any sort of adaptation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/13/nuri-bilge-ceylan-winter-sleep-we-are-not-eating-sugar-in-life-all-the-time\" title=\"\">Winter Sleep won the Palme d’Or</a>, and that was a triumph about which I had complicated feelings, perhaps like those of Ian McEwan fans when Amsterdam won the Booker prize in 1998. There was a sense that this wasn’t quite the best contender, nor quite the winner’s own best work – but nevertheless clearly that of a supremely praiseworthy, prizeworthy artist.</p> <p>It’s a film whose geography has a daunting grandeur: the vast and wintry plain, with its rocky forms, often looks like that of an alien planet, or a planet on which the characters we see are the last humans left. This gigantic setting creates a mesmerising, if slightly mis-matched context for the pain, pathos and absurdity of a sharply observed, intimate domestic drama.</p> <p>Haluk Bilginer plays the insufferably conceited Aydin, a retired, middle-aged actor who has inherited his late parents’ provincial hotel out here, along with the freehold of surrounding cottages. Running the business and collecting rent is delegated to his manager Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan), allowing Aydin the leisure to write a smug, preposterous column for the local paper called the Voice of the Steppe, to bore his guests with memories of having once met Omar Sharif, and to patronise his beautiful young wife Nihal (Melisa Sözen) and divorced sister Necla (Demet Akbag). They have come to hate Aydin – and themselves –for being dependent on his unearned wealth and trapped with him in this icy wasteland, far from the Istanbul they dream about. Bilginer’s performance shows how Aydin has cultivated the style of a worldly man. It is a mask of knowing condescension that does not conceal his own loneliness, disappointment and fear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1pu28BBntI\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1pu28BBntI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Winter Sleep fascinates, saddens and occasionally amuses, at various points on its vast canvas, although I couldn’t help feeling that the landscape’s enormity worked better for Ceylan’s more violently disturbing film Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011), and that the bittersweet Chekhovian pastoral here might have been more intelligible in a more metropolitan or at least less isolated and more socialised setting, such as his Uzak (Distant) of 2002, although I accept the important point is that they are isolated. Tellingly, and touchingly, poor Aydin prides himself on the seriousness of his lost thespian career and on never having done a soap opera. Nihal asks the spiky and self-dramatising Necla if she hasn’t perhaps been watching too many soap operas. The awful truth is that their life is like a soap opera, but played out with a dreary and glacial slowness, even more oppressive in the hotel’s winter off-season.</p> <p>The movie has an oceanic swell, or surge of emotion that appears to be building somewhere in its depths, but never quite breaks into a wave.</p> <p>In fact, the film’s one real dramatic flourish, when Nihal meets Aydin’s resentful tenant Ismail (Nejat Isler), seems overstated and misjudged. The extended dialogue scenes ring truer. Aydin will have long, bitter, subdued conversations with Neclan and Nihal separately, which take place in flickering firelight, as if the end of the world has come and there is no more electricity. They are conversations for which the audience must readjust their sense of conventional dramatic pace, in order to appreciate the unbearable pain and anger that everyone is afraid to express fully, for fear of admitting to the world their own anguish.</p> <p>The first shot in Winter Sleep is of a smoke or steam wispily rising from the soil (oddly, I thought of the hellish vapour coming from the grate in Scorsese’s Taxi Driver). The land is like a fen or a bayou, alternately icy and muddy, essentially hostile, habitable only at enormous human cost: a vision of its inhabitants’ mental landscape.</p> <p>Ceylan paints an absorbing, compassionate portrait of people who are making a painful accommodation with each other, and with a world that rejected them long before they thought about rejecting it.</p> <p>• <a

I blame it for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112854/\">Destiny Turns on the Radio</a>. I blame it for A Serbian Film and the Fun Lovin’ Criminals.

Stopping Pulp Fiction from being made would have saved me a lot of personal strife – especially all the strife I encountered studying film at university during its relative afterglow, where people would pad out their hokey three-minute plots with swath​s and swath​s of tedious babble about continental hamburgers and the imagined subtexts hidden within Ach​y Breaky Heart.</p> <p>On the other hand, without a film like Pulp Fiction to shake things up, we might still be stuck in the early ​1990s, watching endless, ponderous John Grisham potboilers, soundtracked by bloated James Horner scores. As we speak, we might be bracing ourselves for the release of The Pelican Brief 4: Revenge of Justice Rosenberg. That isn’t a world I’d particularly like to live in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSLMN6g_Od4\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSLMN6g_Od4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>And, as I’ve mentioned, I do actually quite like Pulp Fiction. I like its energy. I like how lightly it wears itself. I like most of its performances. Even when it misfires – when the dialogue becomes a little too smug, when its attitude to violence gets a little too throwaway – it’s still undeniably the product of a very singular mind. It’s a good film that I probably won’t ever watch again, because the thrills it summons have all been neutered by its guffy legacy.</p> <p>There are many, many worse films than Pulp Fiction. But this series isn’t about the worst films. It’s about the decent films that can’t possibly live up to the hype ascribed to them. The films rendered numb by criticism and parody. The films you’re sick of before you’ve even watched them, because people have spent years quoting them to you at length. The films that have made you distrust guitars because every arsehole who owns one will invariably sit you down at some point and try to play Misirlou to you. Pulp Fiction is one of these films, and then some.</p>","headline":"Pulp Fiction: my most overrated film","trailText":"Parent to a legion of crap imitations – I blame it for Shrek – the hype over Tarantino’s film renders it almost meaningless.

In the evening, the rain came and he <a href=\"http://i2.cdnds.net/14/36/618x489/showbiz-bill-murray-1.jpg\">squelched down the red carpet</a> for the premiere of his new movie, St Vincent. As the credits rolled and the audience stood, he took to the stage in <a href=\"http://i2.cdnds.net/14/36/618x681/showbiz-bill-murray-3.jpg\">plastic crown and beauty queen sash and still-sodden suit</a>. </p> <p>Thing is: if you’re Bill Murray, every day is Bill Murray Day. Every day a Groundhog Day of being treated like a deity. Every morning brings people if not actually wearing your face, then with your features engraved on their hearts. St Vincent’s director, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0577647/reference\">Theodore Melfi</a>, tells me of a time at Atlanta airport when a stranger ran up to Murray and told him how much she loved him. He told her he loved her too and kissed her – hard, on the lips. “It made her life.” Of the waiter in New York who carried around the $50 note Murray once gave him to enrol in an acting class. This is a man whose visitations – <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2640920/Twice-divorced-Bill-Murray-crashes-bachelors-party-gives-marriage-advice-hoisting-groom-shoulder.html\">crashing a stag do here</a>, <a href=\"http://thechive.com/2011/01/05/what-if-bill-murray-just-showed-up-in-your-karaoke-room-9-photo-exclusive/\">rocking the karaoke there</a> – are taken as elusive proof of his divinity. If God was one of us, the logic goes, he’d be Bill Murray.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b7ad3915-f089-4d5e-8b3a-a709373f71c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504233369/8a12237e-90d2-41af-bd0a-e527be7ad3d6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray in Cannes in 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray at Cannes in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominique Charriau/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Official meetings are correspondingly sacrosanct. I’m allotted 10 minutes, stretched to 15 with begging, then 20 through undignified stalling when the publicist comes to fetch me. No more is possible. Off the promo trail, he’s absolutely unavailable – no agent, no manager, no point of contact other than <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/guide-to-calling-bill-murrays-1-800-number.html\">an unlisted 1-800 number</a> on which you can leave a voicemail. I ask Melfi if he might like to share it with me. He laughs.</p> <p>I wait on a deserted floor at the <a href=\"http://www.trumphotelcollection.com/toronto/\">Trump hotel</a>, sandwiched between two packed ones. The hallowed atmosphere intensifies. After a time, a security guard materialises and discusses the carpet. Then he touches his ear. “Your parcel has arrived,” he says and evaporates. Murray strolls round the corner.</p> <p>“Well, you look delightful,” he says. “And you smell nice.” He’s wearing blue linen and is very tall. His silver hair is blond at the tips, so when he gives a gummy grin, you think of the <a href=\"http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111117164139/telletubbies/images/e/eb/The_Sun.jpg\">baby in the sun on Teletubbies</a>. Later, Tilda Swinton says she thinks he has the look of “a tired child who has laughed so much he aches – but finds it too complicated to fully explain the joke”. That’s true. It’s like talking to a crumpled bag of sweets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b6f547d4-61cb-4832-87db-2b4a5bc2fbcd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504497279/3f74b2a6-c07c-426a-835e-60761beecf44-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray and Saoirse Ronan in Berlin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray and Saoirse Ronan at the Berlin premiere of Moonrise Kingdom, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Teuchmann/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We’re shown to a room and I help him read the Coke bottle label (he only drinks Mexican, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/mexican-coke-is-ditching-cane-sugar-for-high-fructose-c-1459437477\">on account of the corn syrup</a>). We inspect the facilities. He suggests we take a bath or watch a DVD. Four hardboiled eggs and some fried potatoes are ushered in. He doesn’t touch them.</p> <p>I have quarter of an hour left. How did he find Bill Murray Day? “OK. Daunting. I was sort of dreading it, I thought it would be so embarrassing. But people seemed to think it was as funny as I did. It was just as good as having a birthday and a great cake and fireworks.” He thinks more. “It was a good day.”</p> <p>So why do people place such faith in actors? Because what they do seems miraculous? Sure, he says. For him, too. “It’s always a question for me: how are people pulling this off? How can they live with it, how they can be that person up on a screen and then walk down a street or go to a grocery store or drive a car or have a conversation. Like: how does that happen? Where do you get to be superhuman? How can you do it?</p> <p>“People identify with that. They think: I’d love to be Superman for a while, or be the guy who’s being funny and not taking any guff. I wish I could say that to my neighbour or my wife. You’d like to have that kind of freedom. You go: yeah, that’s what you’re supposed to do. That’s what a hero does.”</p> <p>In St Vincent, Murray is a familiar kind of hero: the lovable gruff, the mensch in grouchclothing. Vincent is a rude boozer who bets on the horses and has got a Russian prostitute (Naomi Watts) pregnant. He’s mean to new neighbour, single mum Melissa McCarthy. But then he starts babysitting her lonesome son and we twig: he’s great, under the grump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duZJnlpnmCQ\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/duZJnlpnmCQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The movie plays out like Murray’s greatest hits. He sings slurrily and dances funny, cracks wise and rolls his eyes, a dignified clown, brimful of feeling even at his most brittle. Melfi <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/entertainment/2014/10/16/how-bill-murray-got-cast-vincent/DrIjJ8PuGbDFTay6yyGRJJ/story.html\">originally courted Jack Nicholson</a>, but when he passed, Murray said he was interested, if he could tailor the script to his strengths.</p> <p>And Vincent’s emotional journey follows the same arc as Murray’s characters in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/groundhog-day-perfect-comedy-for-ever\">Groundhog Day</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters\">Ghostbusters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/106026/broken.flowers\">Broken Flowers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96936/lost.in.translation\">Lost in Translation</a>. He gets domesticated. The curmudgeon finds salvation in conventionality. “Vincent has got to acknowledge,” says Murray, “that we all have an obligation to more than just ourselves. In this world it plays out as our fellow man. And ultimately something higher – that’s the ultimate we manifest. But the tasks we’re given here are our families.”</p> <p>Yet Murray’s root appeal is not based on this third-act incarnation. Movies may need to end that way, but off-screen, the closer to average Murray gets, the less we want to be like him. It’s the frank and freewheeling real-life guy we worship, the one who rollicks about dressed like a jumble sale, whose irreverence hasn’t been curbed.</p> <p>So why does he connect quite so deeply? Cameron Crowe, who’s just finished shooting a movie with him, thinks Murray’s detachment from the star system alters his affinity with an audience. Like the new pope, he walks among us. “He’s very skilled at breaking through the barriers that make many celebrities so uncomfortable around their fans. With Bill and his fans it’s an equal playing field. He’s not floating above them in some hallowed showbiz world, he’s right there with them, living life, like the big brother or uncle you look forward to seeing at Christmas. He doesn’t live in a gilded cage and run from his fans, he runs with them. I think he’s even done that – literally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12c35bf9200d386bdd7e058c08098f1d4d1f4cc8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504381530/a06928fb-f7c4-4a02-a94e-1fef2f7f07b9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray at the Ryder Cup in 2012\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray at the Ryder Cup, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ERIK S. LESSER/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“His fame is a fluid, growing thing. Being a fan of Bill Murray never gets boring because he’s not bored, he’s more mercurial and yet somehow more available than ever. In a world where most careers are xeroxes of each other, his is uniquely his own.”</p> <p>For Melfi and Swinton, Murray’s joie de vivre is key. Swinton recalls him larking about with her children on the set of Broken Flowers, partying the night away with the 12-year-old cast of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article7758123.ece/alternates/w620/Pg-06-Moonrise-Kingdom-ap.jpg\">Moonrise Kingdom in Cannes</a>. He has, she says, “a kind of hopeful aspect; maybe only a trick of the light or something about his look that suggests a constant readiness to play. The sense that no foolishness you could ever admit would faze him. The impression of knowing where the best fun can be found at all times.”</p> <p>“From zero to 12,” says Melfi, “we were all doing what we wanted to. As we get older we start getting reservations. We live by society’s code of rules – that’s acceptable and that’s not. Bill doesn’t. He lives his life with a complete joy and freedom. And I would desperately love to say: fuck it I’m not going to work today, I’m going to see this band I like. Or I’m just gonna jump on this train real quick, go to Philadelphia and have a cheese steak.”</p> <p>It’s only Harvey Weinstein – who’s distributing St Vincent in the US – who suggests this could come with a kick. <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/bill-murray-st-vincent-1201328900/\">Speaking to Variety</a> about being a “born-again Murray-ite”, he said: “It’s a religion, where you can act as badly as you want to people, and they still love you. I used to feel guilty about behaving badly, and I met Bill, and it feels so much better.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-59daef5e-9071-4ea6-857b-48cd4febb4a1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504713528/57cfb981-8617-47d9-835b-0245ef22b307-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray in Broken Flowers, 2005\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broken Flowers, 2005</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Murray has licence, almost immunity. He’s Teflon in the face of anything even <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11086967/Bill-Murray-the-more-relaxed-you-are-the-better-you-are.html\">vaguely unsavoury</a> (it’s interesting that in his films he’s often a lothario, but passive, not predatory; more often seduced than seducing). “He has a certain rare animal – snow leopard – quality,” says Swinton. “Kinda dangerous as well as exotic.”</p> <p>Murray was born in the mid-20th century, the middle child of nine, living in a three-bedroom house in Chicago. Before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awjxul278bo\">Second City</a>, before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03vT72PsSeE\">Saturday Night Live</a>, his improv skills were honed round the dining table. Younger brother Joel has said that the aim was to make their father – a slow eater – laugh with his mouth full. (Murray himself has six sons, by a couple of ex-wives, and his conversation sometimes gets snagged on custody.)</p> <p>His parents were Irish Catholics; one of his sisters is a nun. This conspicuous religion adds to his broad church appeal (there’s a citation from the Christian Science Monitor on his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cinderella-Story-My-Life-Golf/dp/0767905229\">golfing memoirs</a>). You don’t need to ask if his faith is important to him. He talks about how 19th-century candidates risk not getting canonised because the church is keen to push ahead with the likes of John Paul II and Mother Teresa. “I think they’re just trying to get current and hot,” he smiles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e247275e4e2e705f6cb1766de48c9aace3c18835\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416493669298/8fa87a47-48f5-4c8c-9442-295c55618905-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saturday Night Live, 1977.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saturday Night Live, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One new saint he does approve of is <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Pope+John+XXI&amp;oq=Pope+John+XXI&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.335j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Pope+John+XXIII&amp;spell=1\">Pope John XXIII</a> (who died in 1963). “I’ll buy that one, he’s my guy; an extraordinary joyous Florentine who changed the order. I’m not sure all those changes were right. I tend to disagree with what they call the new mass. I think we lost something by losing the Latin. Now if you go to a Catholic mass even just in Harlem it can be in Spanish, it can be in Ethiopian, it can be in any number of languages. The shape of it, the pictures, are the same but the words aren’t the same.”</p> <p>Isn’t it good for people to understand it? “I guess,” he says, shaking his head. “But there’s a vibration to those words. If you’ve been in the business long enough you know what they mean anyway. And I really miss the music – the power of it, y’know? Yikes! Sacred music has an affect on your brain.” Instead, he says, we get “folk songs … top 40 stuff … oh, brother….”</p> <p>Murray is loved for being carefree. But face to face he can seem not just serious, but sober, even sensible. People may tweet when he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwwEGjGbxXM\">turns up to serve tequila</a>, but I suspect he also spends quite a lot of time quietly reading the paper. Melfi calls him a “deep thinker” who’s gifted him a lot of books about parenting. And today what really fires him up turns out to be seatbelt safety. In particular the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_legislation\">1965 legislation</a> making them compulsory in new cars. For this, he thinks Ralph Nader is “the greatest living American”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f85feae1-0040-4e69-9291-aff95b89ab91\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504314668/338f5975-acb2-4809-a3dc-ed1dae0464f8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray in his new movie St. Vincent\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Vincent, 2014</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“People thought: ‘Why is this son of a gun making me wear a seatbelt?’ Well, in 1965 I think the number was 55,000 deaths on the highway a year. That’s a lot of people dying. So he’s saved just about a couple of million people by now. It’s crazy! And that’s just one thing he did!</p> <p>“I mean, they made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/schindler-s-list\">a movie</a> about<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler\"> the German who smuggled the Jews out</a>. He saved hundreds. Great man. Deserved a movie. Spectacular. Great film and a great human being. But this guy, Ralph – there’s no movies about Ralph.”</p> <p>His eyes catch light and he leans forward. He could sing Nader’s praises for ever, and starts to try.</p> <p>“Businesses bitch about this guy and people hate him because he’s trying to make change. He hasn’t become like super-crazy-wealthy or anything and it’s not about his celebrity. He’s really interested in improving the quality of life for the whole world. Not just America the entire world.”</p> <p>Was he sorry Nader never made president? No, he was depressed that people blamed him for diverting Democrat votes in 2000, leading to Bush’s victory. “You know: that’s Al Gore’s fault! We didn’t all come here to make the world easier for Al Gore. He should have run a better campaign. He ran a lousy campaign. He was the vice-president during the greatest economic boom in the history of the country.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-df5a0509-8fa8-4bb0-86fc-4b9df3d92628\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504851521/21fd202d-8183-4703-957b-47ebb8437c7e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Groundhog Day, 1993\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groundhog Day, 1993</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He shakes his head, sadly. “Political parties work to cripple their opponents. They spend all their time in office trying to paralyse the work of the others. They try to stifle. It’s cruel, cruel.”</p> <p>The PR is back and my time is up. So: how might things change in the future, I say, gathering my bag slowly.</p> <p>“Well, eventually something horrible will happen, something dynamic and powerful. It’s going to have to be cataclysmic for people to wake up and say: ‘OK, is anyone gonna do this?’ There’s going to have to be a shock of another kind.”</p> <p>I have to stand now, but don’t want to walk away in case he stops speaking. But he rises too, and I’ve misjudged the distance between our seats, so we’re inappropriately close and I’m eyeballing his nipples. It’s intense, but I keep quiet and keep rooted and he keeps talking.</p> <p>“I think something’s gonna have to change. Usually it’s something like war or 9/11 that makes people come together.” The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting\">shooting of Gabrielle Giffords</a> might have been a rallying point, he thought. “Because that’s just a nutter going after someone. And that kind of anger builds and creates horrible events like that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c2ea86e9-25b0-4a36-b896-dfaeb101f6db\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416504680301/6110d6bf-6d05-43a5-9511-0d46fab055b5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Murray at the St Vincent press conference\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray at the St Vincent press conference in Toronto, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Press/REX/Action Press/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He smiles as I inch away. “You know, I wish you could hold all of Congress prisoner and they’d get Stockholm syndrome and have to go along with their captors.

is a very British film about the war in Afghanistan: tense without showing combat, it is the antithesis of Hollywood glory-gore</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>In the 13 years since the war in Afghanistan began, Hollywood has released at least five major feature films about it, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/09/thriller.tomcruise\">Lions for Lambs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/21/brothers-sheridan-review\">Brothers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/zero-dark-thirty-review\">Zero Dark Thirty</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/02/lone-survivor-mark-kermode-review\">Lone Survivor</a>. In the same period, the UK has produced just one – the low-budget The Patrol. Next week, we receive No 2: the tough, gruelling Kajaki, a recreation of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/17/chinook-inquest-military-afghanistan\">lethal real-life 2006 incident</a> in which a group of paratroopers were trapped in a minefield, named after the region in Helmand province where it occurred.</p> <p>Kajaki is a fascinating, revealing artefact, whether or not you find its actual content – a visceral, empathethic study of the British military – of interest. One of the tiny band of non-second-world-war British war films, it has clearly been financed outside mainstream channels – no TV or BFI money here – and has chosen to go its own way with its distribution, having set up an exclusive deal with the Vue cinema chain and funnelling money back to military charities. It has also swerved clear of openly grappling with the thorny political issues that have surrounded the Afghan war – and its related conflict in Iraq – since its inception.</p> <p>Kajaki is not a combat film per se: the courage and heroism on display don’t derive from engagement with the Taliban, but rather a gruesome blunder in to a minefield left over from the Soviet invasion. Kajaki’s executive producer Gareth Ellis-Unwin – best known as one of the producers of The King’s Speech – says Kajaki is “politically agnostic”: although one man lost his life, and several more were grievously injured, it’s a story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/09/military.nato\">procedural cockup and red-tape </a>as much as anything else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01dcd1ab3ec6df01badf8cd00c793bf7f562f033\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495337243/a33df29d-7770-49de-8425-03bdf0f8fbc6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lone Survivor.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lone Survivor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Katis, Kajaki’s director, suggests that in this respect the film is truer to “the nature of war”. During his research, he says, he asked about medals: “How many were for a chosen, planned action, and how many for things going wrong?” The “informal” feedback was that “80%-90%” were given in connection with the latter.</p> <p>Films about the Afghan and Iraq wars will inevitably trigger outraged responses – and not just from Guardian readers. But war films are a staple part of cinema, ranging from extreme, realist statements of radical intent – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-battle-of-algiers\">The Battle of Algiers</a>, <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/screen/story/0,6903,595331,00.html\">Land and Freedom</a> – to fantasies that try to rewrite history – Rambo, Red Dawn. Add in numerous combat documentaries on the one hand, and mythic sci-fi and pseudo-histories – Starship Troopers, Lord of the Rings, Ender’s Game, etc – on the other, and it’s clear we are never far from a war film of one kind or another.</p> <p>But approaching recent conflicts, where the wounds are fresh and the battlefields still active, is something that the British film industry has proved extremely reluctant to do, especially compared with its US counterparts. Probably the closest Hollywood equivalent to Kajaki is Lone Survivor, in which a four-man Navy Seal team is stranded behind enemy lines. Like Kajaki, it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/04/only-ones-sole-survivors-near-death\">based on a real incident</a>, though unlike Kajaki it includes copious combat sequences, with much dubious videogame-style footage along the American soldiers’ sightlines.</p> <p>Kajaki’s makers are anxious to highlight the differences between Hollywood films and theirs. Katis says he was struck by how averse to the trigger-happy antics of onscreen American soldiers the British troops he spoke to were. “That’s just not the British army way. I was told on a number of occasions: we don’t like being called heroes. We’re professional soldiers, just doing our jobs.”</p> <p>There is a wider issue, of course: the US’s superpower status, as opposed to the UK’s post-imperial hangover. Katis says: “We’ve been apologising since the 1960s for being the big boys. America is the new empire on the block, and they are happy to make films that reinforce it. You would expect them to be bullish about their troops.” But the point remains that Hollywood and the US armed forces are in a mutually supportive relationship that generates a supply of pro-military films that – the blip of Vietnam notwithstanding – has ensured that home support for US troops has rarely wavered.</p> <p>The situation in the UK is somewhat different. Katis describes a number of contacts with the army and the ministry of defence that can be characterised as “ambiguous” at best; he says they received plenty of help from individual servicemen but the MoD “got cold feet”. In fact, he says that the US department of defense was significantly more responsive, reading the script within 24 hours. “The MoD isn’t set up that way. They are the whipping boy and have a paranoid relationship with the media. I feel sorry for them, as much as you can for a government bureaucracy.”</p> <p>Be that as it may, Katis remains convinced there is an “institutional bias” in this country against films such as Kajaki, which applies to funding sources as much as Whitehall. However, it turns out to be a case of cut your cloth as you find it.</p> <p>“We couldn’t afford to do big action pieces, so we replaced action with tension. That’s why the story works. These young men are in this situation, and they have to discover the courage inside themselves. At the heart of it is: what would you do?”</p> <p><em>Kajaki is released on 28 November</em></p>","headline":"Why is Hollywood’s take on the Afghan conflict so different from the UK’s?","trailText":"Kajaki is a very British film about the Afghan war: tense without showing combat, it is the antithesis of Hollywood glory-gore. <strong>Andrew Pulver</strong> reports","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495218132/Thomas-Davison-in-Kajaki.-004.jpg","wordcount":"885","commentable":"true","byline":"Andrew Pulver","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-23T16:15:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks","tags":[{"id":"film/war-films","webTitle":"War films","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/war-films","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/war-films","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/lone-survivor","webTitle":"Lone Survivor","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lone-survivor","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/lone-survivor","references":[]},{"id":"film/zero-dark-thirty","webTitle":"Zero Dark Thirty","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/zero-dark-thirty","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/zero-dark-thirty","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andrewpulver","webTitle":"Andrew Pulver","rcsId":"GNL004602","r2ContributorId":"15370","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345733137119/AndrewPulver.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"pulver","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andrew Pulver is Film editor, guardian.co.uk</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewpulver","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/andrewpulver","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/film-and-music","webTitle":"Film and music","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"9434e3e53d3f86ec8e4450aaae0f8bbbcc8e72a6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495223453/Thomas-Davison-in-Kajaki.-009.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495223453/Thomas-Davison-in-Kajaki.-009.jpg","source":"PR ","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Thomas Davison in Kajaki.","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: PR ","caption":"Thomas Davison in Kajaki.

Yet the vibe of a casino (especially an illegal one in a gated mansion or in labyrinthine Koreatown basement) certainly has its allure. An unexpected shade of Rupert Wyatt’s The Gambler – and it’s felt even more here than in Karel Reisz’s 1974 version starring James Caan – is that Mark Wahlberg’s Jim Bennett has precious little lust for the typical high-rollers’ lifestyle. Any thrills felt when the cards turn in Bennett’s favour, as they do on occasion, is on you. This is not about the rush of addiction. Jim Bennett is a man on a mission: he has to get down to nothing, so that maybe he can build himself back up. That is, if he’s still alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"928c745b4478cc77e3d82d1d84a37043623df647\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416500692461/d2e19baa-e8bb-409a-b318-fdb1c66f1346-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Gambler Mark Wahlberg\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">School’s out: Mark Wahlberg in The Gambler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Folger/Allstar/Paramount Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the film’s title, Bennett frequently reminds us that he isn’t a gambler. Maybe he’s suicidal, or maybe he’s just a whiny rich brat. But he hates himself, coming as he does from wealth, privilege and education. By day he’s a college literature professor, browbeating his students with nihilism. Screenwriter William Monahan gifts Wahlberg with cement blocks of text about the pains of mediocrity. There are three in his class who know of his life outside of the lecture hall. One is an ace tennis player Dexter (Emory Cohen) who tutors Bennett’s millionaire mother (Jessica Lange). Another is working-class Amy (Brie Larson), a waitress at an underground gambling parlour, who Bennett claims is the only one in the whole school including himself who can write worth a damn. Finally, there is a Lamar (Anthony Kelley), the star basketball player whose seeming lack of interest in literature leads to a friendship that may offer Bennett his only chance at survival.</p> <p>Mirroring this triumvirate are three different men who smell blood in Bennett’s desperation. He owes more than $200,000 to the gambling ring owned by Mr Lee (Alvin Ing), a medium-sized grifter (Michael Kenneth Williams) and a beast of a loanshark played by John Goodman. We first meet Goodman’s Frank in a Grecian bathhouse, blubber spilling out from beneath his robes as he barks a cruel economic philosophy that, when you set aside all the profanity, actually makes a great deal of sense. He’s the most frightening character in a film full of gangsters, but he’s the only one offering advice. Despite his bluster, he seems to care a little bit about Bennett, the grandson of an industrialist from an age of unrivalled American exceptionalism. Goodman’s extended cameo can sit alongside Ned Beatty’s in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/\">Network</a>, and his scenes are some of the most exhilarating you’ll see in a movie this year.</p> <p>The film is framed with a ticking clock, but does Bennett even want to get out of his hole and pay these men back? Somewhere in the chunky monologues and all-over-the-map music cues there’s the understanding that what Bennett really wants is to call their collective bluffs. They come to realise that threatening him or his family won’t get any traction, but they may get some movement threatening his new friends, particularly Amy. Sure, it’s a little obvious to present the love of a good (and young and brilliant) woman as the reason to give up a death wish, but pretty much everything in The Gambler is meant to be seen as big and metaphorical; there’s an entire sequence devoted to discussing Albert Camus’s The Stranger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gPQXbFs9Y\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5gPQXbFs9Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>If it weren’t for Wahlberg’s dynamite performance and the strangeness of the dialogue, The Gambler would have you muttering: “You jerk, just OD on sleeping pills and shaddap already!” And it would surely be more noble to donate the family money to Médecins Sans Frontières instead of busting at 21. But there’s the undeniable romance (and cinematic virtue) of having an entire film come down to one roll of the dice while the vultures circle above. This spiral of self-imposed despair feels like part three of a trilogy of American financial darkness after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146643/killing-them-softly\">Killing Them Softly</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-counsellor\">The Counsellor</a>. The Gambler isn’t quite so audience-unfriendly, but those looking for a typical Wahlberg thriller might come away disappointed. Others looking for a less sure bet might reap the rewards.</p>","headline":"The Gambler review – Mark Wahlberg gives a dynamite display of self-hatred","trailText":"Rupert Wyatt’s version of this spiral of self-imposed despair isn’t a typical thriller but offers surefire cinematic – if not moral – virtue, writes <strong>Jordan Hoffman</strong><br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416495712709/Mark-Wahlberg-and-Brie-La-004.jpg","wordcount":"737","commentable":"true","starRating":"4","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-20T23:59:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/gambler-film-review-mark-wahlberg-dynamite-selfhatred","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/20/gambler-film-review-mark-wahlberg-dynamite-selfhatred","tags":[{"id":"film/series/first-look-review","webTitle":"First look review","description":"Early reviews from film festivals and advance previews","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/first-look-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/first-look-review","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/mark-wahlberg","webTitle":"Mark Wahlberg","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-wahlberg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mark-wahlberg","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

Last year, Chadwick Boseman found himself at the former residence of James Brown, with Brown’s extended family gathered to judge his impersonation of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw24JnGfuA\">Godfather of Soul</a>. They wanted to hear him talk like Brown, sing like Brown, dance like Brown. “Let me see you do the mashed potato! Lemme see this! Lemme see that! And that!” Boseman laughs, recalling that nerve-racking day. “It was so intimidating to walk into his house, to have his family saying it.’” So did he oblige? “I didn’t. I said, ‘I’m not gonna let you put me on the spot like that. You’ll have to wait and see.’” As it turned out, the family ended up telling stories and showing Boseman their own impersonations of James Brown.</p> <p>That wasn’t the only test Boseman had to pass on the way to securing the lead role in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=get+on+up\">Get On Up</a> – a movie that’s less a straight biopic of James Brown than a haphazard flick through the overstuffed scrapbook of his life. Even by showbiz standards, Brown is a dauntingly distinctive character. There are so many things to get wrong: not just the mashed potato but the voice, the hair, the teeth, the outfits. Added to which, the variables changed from decade to decade as Brown took on new personas: <a href=\"http://www.recordsale.de/cdpix/j/james_brown-mr_dynamit.jpg\">Mr Dynamite</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bke40MQZzu4\">Soul Brother Number One</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHQJDbeT1lM\">The Original Disco Man</a>, PCP-raddled recluse brandishing a shotgun and demanding to know who just used his private toilet. As challenging roles go, as Brown himself would say, it’s a mutha.</p> <p>According to Tate Taylor, director of Get On Up, the first thing he needed to see was Boseman playing Brown in his 60s. That was the achilles heel of the whole project, says Taylor. “I thought, ‘If this isn’t perfect, we will fail, and the whole tone will be wrecked.’ So I said, ‘I need the best fucking actor I can find.’” There had been pressure on Taylor to cast a famous rapper “and all the usual stunt crap,” he says, but Boseman was his only choice for the role. “I just had this suspicion,” Taylor says. “And he nailed it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0f3954e3fffcaa2b6629ed2f10a7bd8aa11f0e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416487214871/b2396407-49f5-498c-a391-db4f38f6247e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'If we took a break and you sat beside me to eat, you'd be eating with James Brown' ...

Boseman. Photograph: Terrence Jennings/Retna</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Few others would have spotted that potential. For one thing, the 37-year-old actor bears very little resemblance to Brown, a fact that’s even more apparent now he’s out of the wigs and jumpsuits, and ranged across a sofa in a London hotel suite. He’s a good six inches taller than Brown, athletic, courteous, relaxed, and his speech is completely intelligible. He was a relative unknown, his only previous high-profile role being baseball legend Jackie Robinson in the movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/42\">42</a>. But that’s very likely to change. Boseman’s performance in Get On Up is already being talked about as one of the year’s best.</p> <p>In terms of technical impersonation, he hits all the right notes (even if he doesn’t actually do most of the singing – the movie uses Brown’s live recordings for that), but Boseman goes far beyond that – no mean feat with a character as tortured, contradictory and essentially unfathomable as Brown. <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-get-on-up-1201268079/\">“Nothing he does smacks of mimicry,” raved Variety. </a>“He feels Brown from the inside out, the way Brown felt his own distinctive rhythms.” It’s turned out to be less an anxiety nightmare than a dream-come-true.</p> <p>Having said that, Boseman didn’t want the role initially. He remembers receiving the Get On Up script among a pile of others and not even reading it. “I just didn’t think there was any point in trying,” he says. “I was like, ‘What’s next? Gimme something else.’ He’s too big an icon, and I’d just played one [in 42]. And in my mind, I didn’t know how you would even approach those dance moves.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdz88MBWomo\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zdz88MBWomo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The mashed potato was just the start. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdz88MBWomo\">Brown’s repertoire of dance steps defies labelling</a>: there were the proto-moonwalk glides, the one-footed cross-stage shuffles, the athletic leaps down into the splits, then scissoring up into a pirouette. The theatrical collapses to the knees and returns to the mic during Please, Please, Please. “I can definitely dance, but pedestrian dancing,” says Boseman. “That’s professional dancing. Just the grooves when he’s at the microphone and directing the band are much more difficult than anybody would ever imagine. Everything is doing something: the head, the shoulders, the legs. And it depends on what song it is too, because he changes it up. That’s hard! He makes it look easy.”</p> <p>Boseman only had six weeks to learn it all. He started out doing five hours’ dance training a day with an instructor, then pushed it up to eight. Even off-set, he was dancing all the time, he says. “The thing is, when something clicks, it makes you want to keep doing it. I would be with friends, just talking, and I’d still be moving. They’d be like, ‘What you doing?’”</p> <p>On set, Boseman stayed in character, too, he explains. “If we took a break and you sat beside me to eat, you’d be eating with James Brown. Till I went home at night, it was JB.” It wasn’t a crazy method-acting thing, Taylor explains; more to do with the effort of imitating Brown’s unique gravelly, slurring southern drawl. “Chad had to retrain his vocal cords and hold them in a different position in his throat, so between scenes he had to keep them where they were. It was fun. We never saw Chad. We called him ‘Mr Brown’. It just felt natural.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7692713b5abbabb19238a8407a14b32c4e80d038\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416487469400/23201574-f4a7-46a7-a464-d472f128b742-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Boseman as Jackie Robinson in 42.

Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Get On Up’s non-linear approach is partly an acknowledgement that Brown’s biography is simply too big to cover in one movie. His life story is so packed with recordings, performances, incidents and encounters, it’s almost impossible to catalogue.</p> <p>Taken as a whole, Brown’s life is almost unbelievable, not just in its breadth but in its inconsistency. He recorded black-power anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0A_N-wmiMo\">Say It Loud (I’m Black And I’m Proud)</a>, then performed it at Richard Nixon’s inauguration. His friends included Al Sharpton and Ray Charles, but also Ronald Reagan and segregationist senator Strom Thurmond. He would fire band members for using drugs, yet came to abuse them himself – hence the shotgun incident.</p> <p>Get On Up at least hints at the demons that plagued him – extreme poverty, abandonment by his parents, growing up in brothels and juvenile prisons in the Jim Crow south – and suggests how they later manifested themselves in the form of abusive, often violent relationships with his band members, wives and lovers. One of the hardest parts of Taylor and Boseman’s job was discussing with <a href=\"http://www.accesshollywood.com/james-browns-ex-wife-deedee-gets-emotional-at-get-on-up-premiere_video_2261037\">Brown’s ex-wife DeeDee</a> exactly how she wanted her domestic assault to be portrayed in the movie. Rather than being protective of Brown’s reputation, his family were open to even more of his dark sides being shown, says Boseman. “But there’s still love. There was a lot of really intimate nostalgia and love for him. This is even true of band members. He was like a father figure to them – and everybody has issues with their father to a certain degree. But when he’s gone …”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/18/get-on-up-chadwick-boseman-james-brown-video-interview\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43db4\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2194591\"                data-video-name=\"Get on Up star Chadwick Boseman: 'James Brown understood his audience' - video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/18/1416313780877/Chadwick-Boseman-talks-ab-024.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452143338\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/18/1416313778147/Chadwick-Boseman-talks-ab-022.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/18/141117GetOnUp-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/18/141117GetOnUp_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/18/141117GetOnUp/141117GetOnUp.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/18/141117GetOnUp.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/18/141117GetOnUp_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Boseman also grew up in a big extended family in South Carolina, just three hours from Brown’s base, albeit in markedly happier circumstances. The son of a nurse and an upholsterer, he claims to have 42 first cousins. He majored in directing at Washington DC’s Howard University. Acting only happened by accident when he decided to take a theatre course, which included a week at Balliol college, Oxford. “I was really only studying it to know what the actor was doing, not really wanting to be up there myself, so it was a surprise to realise I’d caught the acting bug.” But success pushed him in the direction of Los Angeles, where he moved in 2008.</p> <p>Not that he’s ditched plan A. He has written stage plays and directed short films, and recently sold a thriller script to Universal, which he’s working on now (he’s not allowed to say what it’s about). The plan is still to direct as well, he says. “There’ll be a time. And maybe it’ll be easier if you’re a successful actor.”</p> <p>On that front, his star is still very much in the ascendant. Last month, after much casting speculation, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/29/marvel-black-panther-black-superhero-chadwick-boseman\">he was announced as Marvel’s Black Panther</a>, the first black superhero in comics and the first superhero of colour to get their own movie, and an all-round super-cool badass of a character. He’ll make his entrance next year in Captain America 3 with a solo movie in 2017 (again, he’s not allowed to talk about it). After Jackie Robinson and James Brown, that’s a hat trick of African-American icons. He’s not quite known as the hardest-working man in the movie business yet, but it sounds like it’s only a matter of time.</p> <p>• Get On Up is released in the UK on Friday 21 November</p>","headline":"I got the feelin’ – Chadwick Boseman on playing James Brown","trailText":"When he saw the Get On Up script, Chadwick Boseman wasn’t interested.
