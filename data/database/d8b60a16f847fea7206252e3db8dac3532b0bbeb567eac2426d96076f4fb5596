But while there's no doubt everyone is feeling the pinch, it's the most vulnerable members of society who really need to make every penny count.</p><p>That's why Action for Children and Barclays are working together to help families and young people on the lowest incomes make the most of their money with their Financial Futures initiative, a three-year project which empowers people to take control of their finances and stay out of debt. </p><p>Now in its third year, the £1.8m partnership provides basic money management guidance to hundreds of families and young people - many of whom struggle to make ends meet on a daily basis. Topics covered include the value of budgeting, the pros and cons of borrowing from different lenders, the meaning of financial jargon, cutting fuel costs and eating healthily on a budget. </p><p>The workshops, which are run by Action for Children staff and supported by Barclays volunteers at 18 of the charity's projects across England and Wales, have proved popular among local communities. And they're getting results.</p><p>Single mum-of-three Louise from London is just one of many parents who've taken a tighter grip on their finances since attending a workshop. </p><p>Having racked up thousands of pounds worth of debt with expensive doorstep lenders to pay for her children's Christmas presents, she had no idea what to do. The workshops gave her the confidence to say \"no\" to more expensive loans and start paying back what she owes. </p><p>She says: \"Financial Futures has completely changed my perspective on personal finance. I'd buried my head in the sand for far too long, but the workshops made me realise I could take control of my finances and break the cycle of debt. The biggest thing for me was learning how to control my spending. Thanks to the workshops I now think about whether I 'need' something or just 'want it' – it was a simple lesson but it's made all the difference.\" </p><p>Louise has also started paying off her council tax and rent arrears and is looking to save up to £500 a year by changing the way she pays for her ammenities, ditching pricey pre-pay meters for cheaper direct debit systems.</p><p>Other parents have shaved up to £30 off their weekly food bills after sharing tips on how to eat healthily on a budget.These include shopping with a friend to make use of 2-for-1 deals, planning meals, and writing lists that you stick to. </p><p>It's good advice - especially in the context of research from Action for Children and Barclays last summer which found that almost one-in-five people on the lowest incomes (19%) had gone hungry or skipped a meal due to rising food prices. The poll also found that 57% of people on low incomes were finding it more of a struggle to feed their families than they were 12 months earlier, with 19% going without heating in a bid to make up the shortfall.</p><p>This may sound daunting, but those who attend the workshops quickly discover that taking control of their finances is not all doom and gloom. Action for Children's Pete Verity says it's important that people are realistic about wanting to treat themselves. </p><p>That's why the workshops look at ways to cut essential spending, so that there is more left over for life's little luxuries. \"Many parents on tight budgets give themselves absolutely no treats, spending any spare money on their children. But it's very important to give yourself something every now and then, however small, even if your budget is very tight.</p><p>\"These workshops help people focus on what they can do to help themselves stay out of debt, yet still enjoy life. This approach encourages people to become more aspirational for themselves and their children and this can lead to other positive changes,\" Verity says.</p><p>The value of Financial Futures is obvious for the families and young people it supports, but it's also working for the charity's corporate partner. Alan Hands, Barclays sponsorship and donations manager says: \"This partnership has given Barclays employees the chance to use their skills and experience to make a very real and sustainable difference to the lives of people in their local community. We see real value in equipping families with the skills and knowledge they need to make more informed, long-term decisions about their finances so that they can manage their money more effectively in the future.\"</p>","headline":"Too much, too young?","trailText":"<p>The cycle of debt can be an impossibly hard one to break out of.
