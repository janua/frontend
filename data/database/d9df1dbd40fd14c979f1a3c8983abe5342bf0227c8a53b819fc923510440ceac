Sicily is a long way from Dubai, where Nibali is on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, but the memories tumble through him.</p> <p>For a while, at least, it hardly matters that his romantic story from the past is framed by a bleakly familiar backdrop of cycling controversy. We can even briefly set aside the uncomfortable fact that Nibali’s triumphant Tour has since been tainted by four positive drug tests for riders associated with his team, Astana, which is managed by Alexander Vinokourov, who was suspended for two years himsel after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/30/cycling.tourdefrance3\" title=\"\">blood doping in 2007</a>.</p> <p>“It’s true that my hero was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/16/guardianobituaries.cycling\" title=\"\">Marco Pantani</a>,” Nibali says as he recalls a compatriot who won both the Giro and the Tour in 1998 – a year scarred by the infamous Festina affair, which reduced the sport to a circus of cheating. Nibali was only 13 then and he struggled to understand the problems that engulfed his icon after Pantani’s immersion in doping led to isolation, depression and his eventual death.</p> <p>Everything that is tawdry and tragic about professional cycling can be found in the fate of Pantani, who died in 2004. But for the teenage Nibali, racing around Messina in Sicily, Pantani was simply <em>Il Pirata</em> (The Pirate). “I was only really interested in having fun,” Nibali says, “which meant cycling with my cousin and friends. Everyone wore the bandana like Pantani. Everyone wore his yellow shoes and kit.</p> <p>“All us kids had fun imitating Pantani. We loved his image but his style of climbing and sprinting fascinated us – and the way he kept his hands so low on the handlebars. We loved that cool style of riding.”</p> <p>I had heard that Nibali, as a boy, sold photographs he had taken of amateur races in Messina so he could buy a replica of Pantani’s skull-and-crossbones saddle. “Yes,” he exclaims in English before switching to Italian. “Absolutely. I did it so I could buy the saddle and other components. Then my dad started taking pictures of us riding and we could sell those too. It helped because the cost was really high.”</p> <p>Nibali’s extraordinary triumph this year marked the culmination of a long journey of sacrifice. In Sicily there had been few opportunities for an aspiring cyclist. Nibali had to leave home at 16 to travel to Tuscany and carve out a new life in the unforgiving world of road racing. It has taken him 14 long years but he is now only the sixth rider to have won all three grand tours (joining Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Alberto Contador). He had already conquered the Vuelta a España in 2010 and a snowy Giro d’Italia in 2013. In this summer’s Tour de France he finished 7min 37sec clear of the second-placed rider, Jean‑Christophe Péraud.</p> <p>“[Chris] Froome and Contador were ahead of me at the Critérium du Dauphiné [in June],” Nibali says, “but I arrived at the Tour in peak form. I did fantastic altitude training and I could feel it. Boom. I was in great shape. It was the first time I’d prepared for just one race and we saw the impact from the start.”</p> <p>Nibali’s face lights up as he remembers “the amazing first two days in Yorkshire. The crowds were incredible but they made the roads even narrower. There was stress – but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/jul/06/tour-de-france-2014-vincenzo-nibali-late-attack-win-stage-two-video\" title=\"\">winning in Sheffield was beautiful</a>. I took the yellow jersey for the first time and I was very happy. Even if it seemed a bit soon I knew the significance. On that stage Froome attacked first – and then Contador came. I closed them down because we’d discussed it as a team. It was very important to win that day and take control, with your team car in front, for the cobble stage.”</p> <p>His stage two victory in Sheffield featured a clinical attack that suited his nickname. The Shark dominated the rest of the race. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/jul/09/tour-de-france-2014-chris-froome-crashes-out-stage-five-video\" title=\"\">Froome fell twice and retired</a> during the brutal fifth stage across 10 miles of rain-slicked cobbles while Nibali looked astonishingly controlled. “In the morning I was scared. But the first <em>pavé</em> was easier and gave me confidence. By the time I hit the third stretch, the really tough one, I felt ready. The rain meant you needed special bike-handling but it became better. I felt fantastic … afterwards.”</p> <p>Nibali always regarded Contador as his main rival – but he was in charge of the race when the Spaniard crashed on stage 10 and broke a leg. It is hard to believe either Contador or Froome could have beaten Nibali. He rode with supreme conviction and skill in one of the year’s great sporting performances – which made the subsequent controversy surrounding Astana so galling.</p> <p>Nibali should be credited for allowing over half of our two hours together to concentrate on doping. He shakes his head and grimaces when asked to describe his feelings after hearing last month that one of his nine team-mates at the Tour, <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/10/news/maxim-iglinskiy-doping-case-takes-gloss-astanas-stellar-worldtour-season_348318\" title=\"\">Maxim Iglinskiy, had tested positive for the blood-doping agent EPO in early August</a>.</p> <p>“Apart from the obvious reaction – anger – my main feeling was that this was unbelievably stupid. It did not make any sense. He had just renewed his contract. He did not have a massive goal to chase. Our sponsors in Kazakhstan weren’t happy at all. We were in Kazakhstan the week after [at the Tour of Almaty] and there was such a feeling of betrayal because he is a Kazakh rider.”</p> <p>At the time Nibali said: “The mother of the imbecile is always pregnant.” He smiles sadly. “We say this in Italy but it sums up my feelings perfectly. The great things we’re trying to achieve can be jeopardised by a single rider. That’s why it’s so upsetting. One mistake can ruin so much. But I believe cycling is the cleanest sport because of all the doping controls.”</p> <p>Iglinskiy’s brother, Valentin, had already been suspended in September after failing a test for EPO. “Same family,” Nibali shrugs. The problem for Nibali is that Maxim Iglinskiy, if not his brother, was part of his Tour team. “Yes,” Nibali concedes. “But he was not part of my training team. I have a training team of seven and he was never part of it. The two other members of the team are chosen at the last minute. They are like a filler.”</p> <p>Did he speak to Iglinskiy after the positive result? “No,” Nibali exclaims. “He disappeared.”</p> <p>Nibali would love to win some of the Classics and it must infuriate him that, in 2012, he finished second to Iglinskiy in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. “Yes, yes,” Nibali says, raising his hands helplessly. “It’s normal to feel that. But the past is the past.”</p> <p>Last month, a third Astana rider, Ilya Davidenok, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">tested positive, this time for anabolic steroids</a>. “This guy is not from our team,” Nibali insists. “Astana has a satellite team of youngsters. It’s a completely different team. I dug up a little info on him because I didn’t even know who he was. I discovered he was racing with the Kazakh national team. So only the brothers were really associated with Astana and the Kazakhstan federation has been very tough on them. It’s right that they should.”</p> <p>On Wednesday it was announced that a second rider for Astana’s reserve team, Victor Okishev, had <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/11/news/fourth-astana-rider-turns-doping-positive_353629\" title=\"\">tested positive for steroids in May</a>. The catalogue of failed drugs tests could have severe ramifications for Astana in 2015.</p> <p>Does Nibali feel bitter that he has been tainted by association? “No. I’m just surprised. Today we have a biological passport, regular doping control, race controls. If you are doping, you will be caught. Even if the technique of doping can be advanced you will still be caught in another four years. It makes me laugh. Risking and cheating today is for stupid people.”</p> <p>Did he have any doubts signing for Vinokourov, the general manager? “No. I didn’t actually sign with Vino. I signed with the team owner and with Giuseppe Martinelli [Astana’s team-manager] who I know well. The key thing is that they agreed I would take my whole group. This gave me the opportunity to lead my own team.”</p> <p>Nibali smiles when asked if there is anything he could do differently. “If I think too much about the doubters it would not be good.”</p> <p>He is still tied to his deeply flawed hero, for Pantani was mentored and managed by Martinelli at Carrera and Mercatone Uno. During this year’s Tour de France <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/martinelli-believes-nibali-can-win-the-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">Martinelli defended his reputation</a>. “I’ll never deny my past with Marco,” Martinelli said, “because I’ve pretty much nothing to worry about.”</p> <p>Pantani and Nibali are also linked by Emilio Magni who worked as a doctor at Mercatone Uno. Is Nibali still working with Magni? “Yes. He comes from [Nibali’s former team] Liquigas and I’ve been working with him only as my nutritionist. Magni just advises me what I need to eat – and when. He’s the key guy when it comes to weight and getting it down.”</p> <p>Magni and Nibali were both at Fassa Bortolo, before joining Liquigas – whom the rider represented until joining Astana in 2012. A judicial inquiry into doping at Fassa Bortolo was held in 2001 but Nibali stresses that Magni’s good reputation is completely intact. “In 2006 I started with Magni and I took him to Liquigas and I have been with him since. That’s all.”</p> <p>In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/liquigas-cannondale-deny-bertagnollis-dr-ferrari-claims\" title=\"\">Liquigas denied claims by one of their former riders, Leonardo Bertagnolli</a>, that he was given permission by team management to work with Dr Michele Ferrari – one of cycling’s most notorious figures. There have also been recent internet rumours that Ferrari might be in contact with people on the fringes of Nibali’s team. It is an allegation Nibali has quashed in the past.</p> <p>Nibali shakes his head when I ask him if he has ever met Ferrari himself. “No,” he says emphatically. How does he respond to the suggestion that members of his group might have met Ferrari recently? “Maybe in the past they did – but, for sure, not now. I don’t know anything about them seeing him.”</p> <p>Nibali moves on to safer terrain and confirms that his 2015 season will begin in February with the <a href=\"http://dubaitour.com/\" title=\"\">Tour of Dubai</a> – which he rode last year. “It’s great that cycling is becoming more international. And, for me, it’s especially good to start the year in Dubai. I like the race. The weather is perfect and in Europe, in February, you can’t really train. I will start very happily here in Dubai.”</p> <p>Will he consider an audacious attempt to emulate Pantani – the last man to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same year? “It’s not decided yet. The chances are that Fabio Aru [his team-mate] will do the Giro and I’ll focus on the Tour. But I don’t want to close the door on the Giro yet.”</p> <p>Is it still possible to win both in the same year? “Nothing is impossible. Maybe it’s possible for older riders with the right approach. I think it’s doable but next year they have chosen a very hard Tour route.”</p> <p>He is more amused in dismissing the Russian team owner Oleg Tinkov, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/vuelta-a-espana/oleg-tinkov-offers-e1m-top-riders-ride-three-grand-tours-139113\" title=\"\">who offered €1m to cycling’s top four riders</a> – Nibali, Contador, Froome and Nairo Quintana – if they race all three grand tours in 2015. “I want to have a life and see my family too. I can understand the fans’ dream but the chance of anyone competing for all three is almost zero.”</p> <p>There is still time for Nibali to remember his tribute to Pantani after winning the Tour. “I decided near the end of the season to go to the Pantani museum and give them one of my jerseys. Not many people know I received a yellow jersey from Marco’s mother. It meant such a lot to me. It was the same when I went to the museum. I learned a lot about Marco that I didn’t know – that he liked painting. It was very good and touching to remember how much he meant to me as a kid.”</p> <p>Is Pantani still his hero – despite everything? “At the time he was my hero because he won the Giro and the Tour in the same year. It’s difficult to change your view of that hero even when you grow up. I was a kid but I saw the slow decline. I don’t really know what happened but, as a fan, it looked [as] if Pantani was a scapegoat. Everyone pointed a finger at him. That’s our general perception in Italy.”</p> <p>Nibali makes no further mention of Pantani or the Iglinskiy brothers as, after our interview, he charms everyone at a press conference to announce the new route of the Tour of Dubai. Late that afternoon, driving around Dubai with his wife, Rachele, and daughter Emma, it is striking to see Nibali at his most relaxed. In the back seat he blows raspberries on Emma’s neck, making her squeal with delight. The problems of cycling, and the enduring questions around Astana, recede briefly. Even the thought of turning 30 seems to please him – especially as the future seems more crammed with meaning than the fact that he has already won every grand tour.</p> <p>“I don’t think about it,” Nibali says in the fading desert sunlight. “Maybe later I will enjoy the significance but not now. The only thing I realise is that I am with a select group in cycling history. That makes me happy – and determined to improve as a rider. Everyone always told me when you hit 30 you have reached your peak years. That’s what I hope and I expect. I still have a lot to give.”</p>","headline":"Vincenzo Nibali: ‘Today if cyclists are doping, they will be caught’","trailText":"His idol was the tainted Marco Pantani, and two of his Astana

Elinor Barker and Amy Roberts compete alongside Roswell and tickets are available at <a href=\"http://cyclingrevolution.com/\" title=\"\">cyclingrevolution.com</a>.</p> <h2>GRUDGE MATCH ...</h2> <p>Tony Bellew looks for some payback against Nathan Cleverly three years since the latter successfully defended his WBO light-heavyweight title. They fight again, this time at cruiserweight on Saturday (Sky Sports Box Office, 6pm). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/16/nathan-cleverly-tony-bellew-boxing\" title=\"\">Their previous meeting also in Liverpool, in October 2011</a> was explosive and the fighters have been ratcheting up the tension in the buildup to the rematch, with Bellew noting that his opponent “will not want to enter a boxing ring after I have finished with him”. To which Cleverly countered :“There will be no final bell in this fight, it’s going to be brutal. Expect fireworks”. Indeed.</p> <h2>BOXING OLYMPIANS ...</h2> <p>Not so much a grudge match as the resumption of professional rivalry for the 2012 Olympic gold medallist Katie Taylor who continues her battle with Russia’s two-time Women’s World Champion Sofya Ochigava at the World Boxing Championships in Korea on Saturday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/katie-taylor-ireland-gold-medal-olympics\" title=\"\">Taylor beat Ochigava in the finals at London</a> and the 2012 world championships but only after a close fight, which is likely to be the case again here. Savannah Marshall, who experienced joy and despair in 2012 when she became <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/19/savannah-marshall-boxing-world-champion\" title=\"\">Britain’s first women’s world boxing champion</a> with victory over Elena Vystropova but then, hampered by injury, was knocked out in the first round at the London games, is also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/31/savannah-marshall-hartlepool-boxing-south-korea\" title=\"\">a strong contender to defend her middleweight title</a>.</p> <h2>CUP CONCLUSION ...</h2> <p>Roger Federer has been in fine form this season and he will need to maintain that to have a shout at the only title to have eluded him. The one that got away is the Davis Cup and he and Switzerland have their chance against France in Lille (from Friday, Eurosport, 12.45pm). It will be a tough gig. Playing on clay in front of an expected home crowd of 27,000, France have five players from the world’s top 30 to choose from and defeated Davis Cup champions Czech Republic 4-1 in the semi-finals.</p> <h2>BIG MONEY FINAL ROUND ...</h2> <p>One last good walk spoiled for the cream of Europe’s golfers this week as the top 60 earners reach the final of the Race for Dubai at the DP World Tour Championship (from Thursday, Sky Sports 4, 8am). Finishing on a high will be important but so are the big beans on offer in the UAE. Rory McIlroy is on course to break the season prize money record he set when he won this event in 2012. He finished that year with £4,389,800. This season, with two majors under his belt, he has amassed £4,295,610. The total prize money on offer in Dubai is £5,104,250, including £850,688 for the winner.</p>","headline":"The Agenda: Jo Rowsell heads to Manchester for Revolution series","trailText":"Britain’s top cyclists will compete in round two of the Revolution series, while Tony Bellew faces Nathan Cleverly in Liverpool","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/11/15/1416067610425/Track-cycling---mens-team-006.jpg","wordcount":"541","commentable":"false","byline":"Giles Richards","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-18T16:09:37Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/15/the-agenda-jo-rowsell-manchester-revolution-series","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/nov/15/the-agenda-jo-rowsell-manchester-revolution-series","tags":[{"id":"sport/series/the-agenda","webTitle":"The Agenda","description":"Your guide to the week's best sports events, shows and new products.

Premature to pass that rule, claims Brian Cookson<br>• Lizzy Armitstead had called for minimum wage</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Forcing professional cycling teams to pay female riders a minimum wage could be “counterproductive” and result in more women being paid nothing, according to the head of cycling’s governing body, the UCI.</p> <p>Last month the Olympic silver medallist and Commonwealth champion Lizzie Armitstead said it was “pretty crazy” that the best female cyclists in the world had to hold down <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/watch/tv-shows/sportswomen/news/9527167/lizzie-armitstead-calls-for-minimum-wage-for-female-cyclists\" title=\"\">part-time jobs to survive</a>.</p> <p>She called on the UCI to introduce a minimum wage – something the current UCI president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/24/cycling-brian-cookson-uci-pat-mcquaid\" title=\"\">Brian Cookson, promised to bring in within a year of his appointment</a> last September.</p> <p>But 14 months into the job Cookson, who was head of British Cycling for 16 years before joining the UCI, says he has been advised by women within the UCI that it would be “premature to pass that rule at this moment in time”.</p> <p>At the same time he suggested women’s races should be allowed to get longer and harder in order to make them more exciting to watch and ride.</p> <p>Speaking at an event at the Rapha store in Manchester on Thursday evening, Cookson said: “The women who have been involved in the Women’s Road Commission have told me that the result of that would not be 500 women suddenly being paid the minimum wage; they’ve told me that actually most of the teams that currently present themselves as professional teams would fold or re-register as amateur teams, so they wouldn’t end up paying those women anything at all anyway.”</p> <p>He added: “It’s a bit of a chick and an egg [situation], I’m told, and passing a simple rule at this point in time could potentially be counterproductive. But it does remain an important objective.”</p> <p>The minimum wage for male UCI World Tour cyclists is €35,000 (£27,800) per annum, with the average salary reported at €265,000 (£210,500) in 2012, according to Ernst &amp; Young. Discount the big earners and this figure would probably equate to €125,000-150,000 (£99,000-120,000), <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/a-blueprint-for-womens-road-cycling\" title=\"\">according to an estimate from Steve Beckett</a>, former head of cycling at British Sky Broadcasting. Female elite cyclists reportedly earn just €20,000 (£16,000) per annum – and those are the lucky ones.</p> <p>Cookson suggested women’s cycling should be split into two divisions – one “genuinely professional, which we will insist does pay a minimum wage”, and a “lower level”, which would not.</p> <p>“There is nothing to stop a women’s team from paying parallel salaries to men’s teams if they can do it, if they can raise the sponsorship. Passing a rule won’t do that,” he said.</p> <p>Women’s races could be made more difficult in order to make them more exciting to ride and watch, suggested Cookson. Currently UCI rules prevent elite women from riding more than 140km in a stage, compared to the maximum distances of 240-280km for men.</p> <p>He said: “There is no reason why women’s road races should not be harder and longer. Most women’s races are well within the distances in the regulations and it’s certainly something that we could look at.”</p> <p>But he suggested there can be an “over-simplistic knee-jerk reaction” to the problem. He said the original demand last year from <a href=\"http://totalwomenscycling.com/road-cycling/sportives/timeline-la-course-by-le-tour-de-france-came-31206/\" title=\"\">Le Tour Entier pressure group</a> – led by the four-time former Ironman world champion Chrissie Wellington with multiple world champion cyclists Marianne Vos and Emma Pooley – for a women to ride the same, full Tour de France route as the men was unrealistic.</p> <p>“I don’t think that would work,” he said. “The Tour de France organisers tried it to a lesser extent before and it was a disaster. If you suddenly did it one year it would be counterproductive, it would put back the development of women’s cycling … I would like to see a week-long women’s Tour de France, a challenging event, some mountain stages and so on. I think these things need to be changed incrementally.”</p> <p>He added: “People say: ‘Why don’t you insist that there is a women’s team associated with every men’s team?’ Well I don’t want women’s sport to always be secondary to men’s sport. You’ve seen that with the Tour of Britain this year which has been hugely successful without being attached to a men’s event … I think there are sponsors out there who would be interested in sponsoring women’s cycling but not men’s cycling, for whatever reason.”</p>","headline":"Paying minimum wage to pro women cyclists could backfire, says UCI","trailText":"Paying minimum wage to professional women cyclists could be counterproductive, according to the UCI president Brian Cookson","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/11/14/1415965896273/Brian-Cookson-006.jpg","wordcount":"714","commentable":"true","byline":"Helen Pidd","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-17T11:58:59Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/14/women-cyclists-pay-minimum-wage-uci-brian-cookson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/nov/14/women-cyclists-pay-minimum-wage-uci-brian-cookson","tags":[{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/uci","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/uci","references":[]},{"id":"sport/lizzie-armitstead","webTitle":"Lizzie Armitstead","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"society/equality","webTitle":"Equality","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/equality","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/equality","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenpidd","webTitle":"Helen Pidd","r2ContributorId":"19855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399294395431/Helen-Pidd-byline-NEW-003.jpg","firstName":"helen","lastName":"pidd","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Pidd is northern editor of the Guardian, based in Manchester.

Nationals, then the Tour Down Under and then the Great Ocean Road Race.</p> <p><strong>How does it feel to be looking at the final stages?</strong></p> <p>I’m looking forward to the races as best I can, but looking forward to my future as well, and some slightly quieter, less strenuous challenges after my last race.</p> <p><strong>What sort of things will you be getting up to?</strong></p> <p>I’m involved in a couple of things with some companies I work with, like Oakley, but also a couple of things with design and development and testing with the BMC Bikes that I’ve been riding on the last five years. And some PR and media relations and so on.</p> <p><strong>So you’re not exactly going to be short of activities?</strong></p> <p>Absolutely not. All spare moments to come will be dedicated to my four-year-old, and I’ve got a few other things I’m involved with in Australia and in Europe as well.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever had a morning when you woke up and thought, “I have nothing to do today”?</strong></p> <p>Not since I started cycling. Probably school holidays at age 12, about 25 years ago.</p> <p><strong>You should try one out now and then, Small Talk recommends them.</strong></p> <p>I’ve had days when I’ve woken up and didn’t want to do anything. But I might try one of those next year if I get the chance.</p> <p><strong>So the Tour Down Under. Simon Gerrans tends to be in deadly form that </strong><strong>time of year, and Orica-GreenEDGE really focus on it as their race. How do </strong><strong>you counter that?</strong></p> <p>Like this year, prepare as well as you can, be there as best as possible. We’ll be looking at the stages to see how well they suit someone like Simon Gerrans or myself. For the Nationals we just have to be realistic – BMC will have three, and Orica could have as many as 15, so the task is ahead of us. Have to hope that a bit of luck helps the race pan out in our situation. Orica prepare these races as thoroughly as any other big race of the year, so they’re hard to beat, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be beaten.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"orica\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/badtimmy/11905745786/in/set-72157639683320793/player/\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Strength in numbers: the Orica-Greenedge team in the Nationals. Photograph: Tim Renowden</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>It’s been a pattern in your career that you have to ride unaided against a rival with a strong team – are you sick of doing that?</strong></p> <p>There have been quite a few occasions, yeah, when I’ve been isolated, I spent years at the Tour often isolated. But when it came down to win or lose the Tour in 2011, all those years of experience being solo proved to be very, very useful.</p> <p>That allowed me to win the Tour and that’s just the path my career’s taken. For years I didn’t have a team that had real faith in me, or the experience for a team to be built around me or for whatever reason, but in the end I got together with BMC in 2010/11, we had a fantastic team and the results proved that.</p> <p><strong>You’ve made a few political statements in your career – will you be </strong><strong>liberated to be more vocal politically once you’ve retired?</strong></p> <p>Sometimes with athletes if you’re representing a commercial entity or asked not to comment on certain subjects it’s easier not to comment on anything at all. I’ll probably have a little bit of involvement but I’ve got so many things on already…I don’t think a career in politics is a desire for me. Possibly I’ll voice an opinion, but I’m not a spokesperson for politics, I’ll leave that to those who are experts in the subjects.</p> <p><strong>Chris Horner won the Vuelta España when he was just shy of 42, are we going to see a comeback from you in four years?</strong></p> <p>[Laughs] No! I could have gone on, I could have continued longer in my career, but my thing was, if I continue will I make my career better? I’m not so sure about that, so when I call it stop it’ll be stop. I’ll keep riding my bike, I hope to stay very fit and healthy, that’s my intention, but to race at the top level – no, the first of February is going to be my last race. After that some small events maybe but at the top level, that’s going to be it.</p> <p><strong>Will you just cruise around Victoria taking everyone’s best times on the </strong><strong>cycling apps?</strong></p> <p>I’d rather spend my time riding my bike than talking about riding my bike.</p> <p><strong>So you’re collaborating on design work – what are you doing to the bicycle? Have you reinvented it?</strong></p> <p>[The engineers] have put forward some concepts, particularly in handlebars but also in communications – integrating technology into cycling further. That’s been very interesting because it puts me five or ten years out of the headspace that an athlete would normally work in. I want to see the development from here. When I look back ten years at the equipment we used – now we have mobile phones, computers, how the bicycles were ten years ago and what we ride today –anything’s possible. Why not be creative and imaginative?</p> <p><strong>If anything’s possible are there any plans to develop hoverbikes?</strong></p> <p>Which bikes?</p> <p><strong>Hoverbikes.</strong></p> <p>We’re working on handlebars right now! Maybe I’ll propose that at the next meeting with the designers.</p> <p><strong>Small Talk would appreciate it if you could.</strong></p> <p>We’re looking at human-powered vehicles at the moment. You might have to speak with Nasa about this before I can give any input.</p> <p><strong>As it happens, both you and Small Talk are Eltham high school alumni…</strong></p> <p>No way!</p> <p><strong>True story.</strong></p> <p>I was just at my high school reunion on Saturday. 20 year reunion, class of ’94.</p> <p><strong>How was that?</strong></p> <p>It was fun, actually. Everyone has aged 20 years, but not many of them showed it, and everyone had a similar personality. The ones that were funny were still funny, that ones that were a bit nuts were a bit nuts, the ones that studied very hard now build satellites and lecture at universities and are research scientists at CSIRO and so on. In terms of journalists I don’t think there were any in my year.</p> <p><strong>Did you find yourself slipping back into the roles you had at school?</strong></p> <p>I felt completely like I was 15 again, it was fantastic. I think we all did, actually. I didn’t know what to expect really, it was the first reunion I’d ever been to. It was a really nice afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Oh, because you wouldn’t have been in the country usually?</strong></p> <p>No, I’ve spent so much time overseas. I’ve seen in passing maybe ten people over the last 20 years, but I’ve been living overseas nine or ten months of the year. That’s why I read the Guardian Australia online to keep abreast of what’s going on. The other side of the world is the other side of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a16e3b1c475d76af1e01cd81104be8eb9a41dbe4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1415924340229/9fe5f2b0-78f4-4e46-8f28-5f61a8d860d2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"cadel evans predictor\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cadel Evans in the memorable Predictor colours in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Friedemann Vogel/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nice of you to say. So what’s the worst team kit? We were recently recalling the pink Predictor-Lotto jersey from 2008.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, well I didn’t even know what Predictor was, and then I turned up for my local group ride and someone told me. [It’s a Belgian brand of pregnancy test.] That colour was probably the least favourable, but I never had to race in green, which I’m happy about.</p> <p><strong>Not a fan of green?</strong></p> <p>I don’t know, green doesn’t often look good in cycling. For professional cycling teams anyway. But probably Predictor would be a good pick.</p> <p><strong>Did you wonder how many pregnancy tests they were hoping to sell from </strong><strong>sponsoring your team?</strong></p> <p>[coyly] I… don’t know those numbers. Often it’s just about brand awareness. At least everyone who watches the cycling knows about Predictor. They may not know what it is, but if they ever go in to buy a pregnancy test, maybe that’s where the branding starts.</p> <p><strong>Does a cyclist of your stature still get hit by car doors?</strong></p> <p>I certainly have to watch out for them. People ask about the Tour and how scary it is, but no – car doors and being hit from behind are still what scares me the most, being a professional cyclist.</p> <p><strong>If you had played another sport, what would it have been?</strong></p> <p>What I wanted to be, or what I had the talent to be?</p> <p><strong>If you could have been anything.</strong></p> <p>When I was young I wanted to play in the Australian cricket team but I had no talent. When I got a bit older I would have loved to race V8 Supercars, but same thing.</p> <p><strong>What’s your cricket specialty? Bowler, batsman?</strong></p> <p>Occasional participant, that’s all.</p> <p><strong>Fielding at fine leg?</strong></p> <p>That’s the least desired position, is it?</p> <p><strong>It’s the least likely to have to do much.</strong></p> <p>Oh right, that’s why I always ended up down there. When I played when I was young I tried to bowl fast, I tried to spin it, and I couldn’t do either.</p> <p><strong>It’s been a pleasure to chat, thanks for the time.</strong></p> <p>Thanks Small Talk, I’ll see you next time.</p>","headline":"Cadel Evans: 'Car doors and being hit from behind scare me the most'","trailText":"The Tour de France winner on retiring from cycling, why he would rather wear pink than green, and the realisation that he would never make it as a cricketer","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1415924167588/9058318a-85fe-41c4-adbf-b71b4826d4b7-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1545","commentable":"true","byline":"Geoff Lemon","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-17T11:30:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/14/cadel-evans-car-doors-hit-from-behind-scare-most","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/nov/14/cadel-evans-car-doors-hit-from-behind-scare-most","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/series/smalltalk","webTitle":"Small Talk","description":"guardian.co.uk asks the sporting stars the big questions.

too</a></li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Summer is the easy bit for cyclists. The challenge comes when the temperature drops and the nights draw in. But do not fear: winter cycling is not only more fun than you think, it is also easier than ever, thanks to various advances in cycling technology. The greatest of all concerns lights. Not so long ago these were brick-heavy and feeble; now LED technology means even a pocket-size gizmo weighing 50g packs retina-scorching power and can be charged from a USB port.</p> <p>For me, the biggest motivation to cycle through the winter is appreciating the colder months. Rather than just sitting indoors and waiting interminably for them to pass, I embrace feeling the winter rain against my face, or basking in the brief appearance of thin sunshine. So don’t lock your bike away – keep riding. Here’s my advice for getting the most out of it.</p> <h2>The temperature<br /></h2> <p>For longer rides in winter there are two key rules: the first is to not overdress. Set off in an outfit in which you feel a bit chilly for the first few moments, and you’ll soon warm up. If you begin warm, you’ll end up overcooked. The exception to this is extremities – your head, feet and hands generally feel colder the longer you ride.</p> <p>Rule two is layering. Choose a few thinner garments – if you want to add a thermal base layer, the sports giant <a href=\"http://www.decathlon.co.uk/\">Decathlon</a> supplies <a href=\"http://www.decathlon.co.uk/300-longsleeve-cycling-baselayer-white-id_8217438.html\">a very good bargain one from its in-house B’Twin range</a>.</p> <p>If you’re a fan of bike gear then anything you can remove quickly is a bonus – arm and knee warmers offer even more flexibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"545a78bb6b7d9669b7578e17b652b9d7d22ae95f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414139239358/dd25518e-77f4-4c73-9d4c-e04923bd482b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cyclist on wintery street.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It’s cold, it’s snowing – or is that sleet? – but you’ll soon warm up. Honest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Winter-proofing a bike<br /></h2> <p>The good news is that modern bikes are generally pretty winter-proof to start with, particularly thanks to sealed bearing units, which help keep everything dry and rust-free inside. As the roads get wetter and icier, you can buy bike tyres dotted with little metal studs that offer more grip – try the Schwalbe ones at <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/schwalbe-snow-stud-performance-kevlar-rigid-mtb-tyre/\">wiggle.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>When it’s very rainy, you can use a thicker, wet-weather chain lubricant, which won’t get washed away too easily – <a href=\"http://muc-off.com/lube/32-wet-chain-lube-5037835867008.html\">Bio Wet Lube by Muc-Off </a>is great. Bikes particularly appreciate the odd rub-down with a rag after grubby weather. If you’ve got rim brakes give the wheels an occasional wipe to help your stopping power.</p> <h2>Cycling in the dark<br /></h2> <p>As mentioned, riding in the dark is easier than ever thanks to the astonishing recent advances in LED lights. There’s a vast range on offer, from about £5 a light to well over £200. <a href=\"http://cateye.com/intl/\">Cateye</a> offer a decent range of lights starting at reasonable prices. For something more expensive, but very bright and indestructible, UK brand <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/exposure/front-lights/\">Exposure</a> are great.</p> <p>Bear in mind, though, if you’re only cycling along urban streets then the aim is to be seen by others rather than to show the way ahead. This is where the smaller lights that flash like a 1970s disco are invaluable – I recommend the LEDs by <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/knog-blinder-4-standard-led-rear-light/\">Knog Blinder</a>.</p> <p>If you’re taking to the country lanes, then the key thing is brightness. Plenty of modern front lights are bright enough to illuminate the way, like <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/lezyne-mega-drive-front-light-2013/\">Lezyne Mega Drive</a>, and some even come with dip functions so you don’t blind the oncoming traffic: see <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/exposure-strada-mk5-front-light-with-remote/\">Exposure Strada</a>.</p> <h2>Leisure cycling<br /></h2> <p>A normal road bike doesn’t have to hibernate during winter. Pick the right sunny day and the country roads are all yours. You can even stop to defrost in front of a roaring pub fire. Or embrace the filthy weather with something more extreme. Many mountain biking enthusiasts would insist that the pursuit is more fun the muddier it gets. And speaking of mud, there is <a href=\"http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/cyclocross\">cyclocross</a>, where thin-tyred bikes are raced around grassy circuits, occasionally hoisted on to shoulders to be carried over obstacles. Formerly the slightly ascetic preserve of men with wiry limbs and dirt-spattered faces, cyclocross is becoming increasingly popular and inclusive.</p> <h2>My favourite ride in winter<br /></h2> <p>The Surrey hills: starting in south-east London and ending in Westerham, Kent, a half-hour cycle from home brings me gorgeous countryside, picturesque villages and – as the name implies – some leg-warming inclines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b0940732fbbdfa32c1a8b5c1135368261e9f531\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414139396856/eac513c4-c616-482b-bc10-820fbfb5d57f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cyclist in snow.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get your layers and lights on and you’re set for winter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MCT/Landov/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Five best bits of winter cycling kit</h2> <p><strong>Water or windproof jacket</strong></p> <p>For a cheap and cheer-ful one, try Dhb, the in-house brand of the bike-seller Wiggle (<a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb/cycling-waterproof-jackets/\">from £12.99, wiggle.co.uk</a>). If you’ve got a little more cash, then try a new British brand, Vulpine, (<a href=\"http://www.vulpine.cc/Shop/Mens/Jackets-Gilets/ICAT1000/MENS-SOFTSHELL-JACKET/ITM1000\">from £169, vulpine.cc</a>).</p> <p><strong>Gloves</strong><br /></p> <p>You need a reliable all-rounder. I use SealSkinz (<a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/sealskinz-all-weather-cycle-glove/\">£36</a>), which are comfortable, flexible and weatherproof.</p> <p><strong>Ear covering</strong></p> <p>Feeling your ears slowly succumb to frostbite in a winter wind is no fun. Earmuffs and helmets don’t really mix, so use anything from a full-head skullcap to a headband. Sporty skull caps are available at evanscycles.com (<a href=\"http://www.evanscycles.com/search?query=skullcap&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\">prices start at £8.54</a>) or try asos.com (<a href=\"http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Rib-Turban-Headband/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=4328743&amp;cid=6449&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=36&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Green&amp;totalstyles=366&amp;gridsize=3&amp;r=2\">prices start at £8.00, asos.com</a>) for a more fashion-conscious headband.</p> <p><strong>Waterproof overshoes</strong><br /></p> <p>Cycling shoes with cleats are the best winter investment you can make. They protect against (most) rain, and keep your toes snug. I like the Altura Airstreams at evanscycles.com. (<a href=\"http://www.evanscycles.com/products/altura/airstream-overshoe-ec019979\">£18.99</a>)</p> <p><strong>Neckwarmer</strong><br /></p> <p>My best cycling friend is my Buff (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Buff-Polar-Reversible-Functional-Headwear/dp/B004GUSUUC/ref=pd_cp_sg_2/276-4585760-5001869\">from £15, buffwear.co.uk</a>) – a windproof modern-day take on the snood. Or be fancy and buy a luxury cashmere version from Johnstons of Elgin (<a href=\"http://www.johnstonscashmere.com/retail/womens/cashmere-merino-lambswool-lamora-accessories/cashmere-chunky-texture-snood.html?gclid=CIz3z7ueosECFUrpwgod2VMAjA\">from £120, johnstonscashmere.com</a>). </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog\"><em>Peter Walker edits the Guardian’s cycling blog</em></a></p>","headline":"How to enjoy cycling in winter","trailText":"<strong>Peter Walker: </strong>Don’t put your bike away when the temperature drops: embrace the cold, wet months with good cycle lights and clothing","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414138256117/A-cyclist-tackles-a-snowy-006.jpg","wordcount":"915","commentable":"true","byline":"Peter Walker","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-15T22:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/12/enjoy-cycling-winter-bike-lights-clothing","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/12/enjoy-cycling-winter-bike-lights-clothing","tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/series/do-something-active","webTitle":"Do Something active","type":"series","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/do-something-active","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/series/do-something-active","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/do-something/do-something","webTitle":"Do Something","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/do-something/do-something","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/do-something/do-something","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/do-something","webTitle":"Do Something","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/do-something","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/do-something","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"travel/cyclingholidays","webTitle":"Cycling holidays","type":"keyword","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/cyclingholidays","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/travel/cyclingholidays","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"walker","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

Whether it’s the Tour or any other race, it’s what I love doing.</p> <p>“I love racing and being able to compete at the front – to be with a team of guys who you enjoy being with, and who you work together well with. That’s what gets me through the winter when I’m riding those long hours on my own.”</p> <p>Froome abandoned the 2014 Tour with a broken hand and fractured wrist following three crashes in two days. He responded by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/14/alberto-contador-wins-vuelta-espana-chris-froome\" title=\"\">finishing second in the Vuelta to Alberto Contador</a>.</p> <p>After a period of rest and recuperation in which he got married and was able to reflect on 2014, Froome is now keen to resume training for 2015.</p> <p>“I’m actually really hungry to start training again and keen to get back going,” added Froome, who will once again spend the winter training in Kenya, South Africa and Monaco. “The Tour was a disappointment but I’ve still got a few victories I can be happy about this year. Also finishing the Vuelta off in such a decent way, after having all the setbacks – that for me was probably more important than anything else.</p> <p>“It means I’ll be able to go forward into next year without starting from a negative position. I can go in with a clean slate and give it my best shot. I think the biggest point of the year for me were the first few stages of the Tour. Starting up there in Yorkshire was something I’ll never forget. It was massive and an incredible experience.</p> <p>“Coming in as the previous winner and having that home support was huge. In terms of performance and satisfaction, I think the Vuelta was definitely the one. It left me with the best feeling.”</p> <p>Vincenzo Nibali succeeded Froome as the winner of the Tour’s yellow jersey with a dominant victory in the 2014 race.</p> <p>The Italian will be back to defend his title when the race begins in Utrecht on 4 July and is unlikely to target a Giro-Tour double.</p> <p>Nibali <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/exclusive-interview-vincenzo-nibali\" title=\"\">told cyclingnews.com</a>: “I honestly don’t think I’ll do the Giro d’Italia.</p> <p>“I said I’d do the Giro if I have to, but if I ride it, I want to ride it to win it.</p> <p>“At Astana we’ve also got Fabio Aru, who is more suited to the Giro d’Italia than the Tour de France.</p> <p>“And so if I ride the Giro, I’d overshadow him. So the team wants Aru to ride the Giro and I ride the Tour. I understand that choice.”</p> <p>While Froome hinted at frustration at the Tour omitting a long time-trial, Nibali is happy with the route.</p> <p>“I like the route of the Tour de France because it’s similar to this year’s route but with even less time trialling,” he added.</p> <p>“I couldn’t have asked for much more and the route was perhaps the final factor on deciding my goals for 2015 and again targeting the Tour de France.”</p>","headline":"Chris Froome’s stance on competing in 2015 Tour de France softens","trailText":"Chris Froome’s stance on riding the 2015 Tour de France could be softening after he initially hinted at a reluctance to ride the race","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/11/11/1415722792340/Chris-Froome-006.jpg","wordcount":"643","commentable":"false","byline":"Press Association","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-14T16:27:05Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/11/chris-froome-team-sky-tour-de-france-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/nov/11/chris-froome-team-sky-tour-de-france-2015","tags":[{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/chris-froome","references":[]},{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-cd36223f-4351-46b0-b729-a08e0f2c3910","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/11/11/1415722798423/Chris-Froome-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/11/11/1415722798423/Chris-Froome-011.jpg","source":"Beadyeye/Rex","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Chris Froome","suppliersReference":"3894709ag","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Beadyeye/Rex","caption":"Chris Froome had initially appeared reluctant to take part in the 2015 Tour de France but seems to have had a change of heart.

Webb, who has five BMX world titles, straps on the latest sports video cameras and takes them for a tailwhip<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>“I’m a show-off. That’s what we do.” Mark Webb is not coy about the nature of modern BMX-riding; an intensely competitive sport that demands rigorous training, high risk and brazen showmanship. Though only 29, Webb has five world titles and a veteran’s understanding of the BMX world, testified by an unconventional skeleton that bears the evidence of two smashed knees, a broken back and a foot that “doesn’t really work anymore”.</p> <p>Film-making and extreme sports have always gone hand in hand and handheld amateur videos filmed in skateparks have long been the primary way for skaters and BMXers to gain exposure. “Ten years ago, you’d have that one mate with a Handycam who’d film a day’s session and spend a week editing it,” says Webb says. “That’s changed now. Everything’s become instant.” Mobile internet, social media and, now, tiny, durable, hi-res cameras have allowed riders like Webb to document their careers day by day, hour by hour, and to build huge, devoted fanbases online. This is also, Webb says, a large part of what makes him a bankable product. “Social media makes you who you are these days, it’s the be-all and end-all. Riders have to be taking photos, filming clips and uploading them every day, that’s where the value is.” We conduct our trial at a sparkling new indoor skatepark in Bognor Regis, and throughout the morning young fans sheepishly accost Webb for signed helmets and, inevitably, photographs. Webb grins gamely and offers fist-bumps. “Having loads of Instagram followers is almost more valuable than having five X-Games medals,” he says.</p> <p>Much of what makes video so important to BMXers is to do with evidence – the visible proof that a trick has been mastered or even pioneered. “You can’t just say ‘I’ve dropped a new trick for the first time ever’. Unless you can back that up with evidence, no one’s going to care.” Webb has created a number of tricks in his time, including, a few years ago, the death-defying Decade 360, in which the rider and then the bike spin around in mid-air. “Funnily enough,” he recalls, “that trick was leaked. I was practising it at a skatepark and some kid filmed it and the cat was out of the bag.”</p> <p>Though this lack of privacy is “frustrating”, Webb thinks action cameras are now an indispensable part of the rider’s toolkit, not only for POV shots, but as a replacement for all kinds of skate-park filmmaking. “You can hold them in your hand, throw them around and upload the footage immediately. It’s the only camera I need now.” So, with three cameras glued to his helmet, he pulls a pair of gloves over his tattooed hands and disappears over the crest of a quarterpipe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"058c19377a46381419bc2efd7c2a16aa25e8bf95\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415203783520/9187c569-50cb-46f9-8703-906dbb5e5a59-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>GoPro Hero4 Silver</strong><br /><strong>Market-leading, multi-function camera with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity — shop.gopro.com, £289.99 </strong></h2> <p>This is the one I know best and it works beautifully. Because it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth you can turn the camera on and off with your phone, save the footage and instantly put it online. You can mount it to point in any direction and I’ve seen one get run over by a car and survive. The only problem is that, when you’re using the Wi-Fi, the battery drains quicker, and this new one has a screen which would drain more power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ea1ef618b38a0727455c176ff7f843373ad3e1c4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415204366540/31df2ae9-7e38-4f52-9f60-11e7b67d934d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Polaroid Cube <br /><strong>Tiny cube with powerful magnet attachment – photojojo.com, £63, plus shipping </strong></h2> <p>This is the one that immediately interests me – it’s so small you could eat it, and you could film without anyone realising you had a camera.

The magnet’s very strong, but it fell off almost immediately when I stuck it to my handlebars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2cbff182341fd39147d40c8aa1445225d7ca7cd7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415204808782/af425d47-91a9-4b4a-b004-ab9f3a91d9e0-460x360.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>JVC GC-XA2BEU </strong><br /><strong>Rubberised, HD camera, shock- and splash-proof — currys.co.uk, £189.99 </strong></h2> <p>It looks like a full-sized, normal camera which has been shrunk. It’s got Wi-Fi, which I think is the most important thing, but the mount moves around too easily in its socket. It also doesn’t have a case, which is fine but the lens itself looks a bit vulnerable – I think it could crack if you dropped it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"052a1a35c7cfb887b34ac48a1be11caf0504ff43\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415204727014/58dbf741-0c97-45d3-b66d-c1228753fbcb-406x420.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"406\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Panasonic HX A500 E<br /><strong>High-quality 4K unit with separate, head-mounted lens, cvp.com, £285 </strong></h2> <p>This one’s off <em>Star Trek</em>, or maybe <em>Fun House</em>. It’s 4K, so really high quality, but the design seems like a backward step. Everyone else is trying to get away from wires. If you’re doing an extreme sport, the last thing you need is a length of braided cable dangling around your head and neck. It’s impractical, it’s bulky and it looks bizarre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3baad6a9cb062e08e0376b50d7c0a90069278e7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415204867914/1b5f4526-d262-4df8-a249-8a5c361779d7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sony HDR AS100VR<br /><strong>Slim HD camera with sealed case and wireless, wrist-mounted screen — johnlewis.com, £299 </strong></h2> <p>This, undoubtedly, is a good camera, and Sony is a very reliable brand.

winter</a></li></ul>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>“Wear Lycra.” These are not, on the whole, words I welcome on a Sunday morning. Neither are, “The brakes aren’t great,” nor: “If at any point you feel scared, just pick up your bike and run.” And yet I found myself in Lycra, looking out over the fields of Essex to Canary Wharf on the horizon, legs quivering, while Ben Spurrier of <a href=\"http://viciousvelo.blogspot.co.uk/\">Vicious Velo</a> attached my pedals to a Condor cyclocross bike.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/cyclocross\">Cyclocross</a>, for those who aren’t Belgian, is a mix of road and off-road cycle racing. You whirl around a pitted, humped, gravel and grass track, thundering over logs, across ditches, up banks and through woods, on a thin-tyred road bike – the sort many would use to commute to work. It’s a way for keen cyclists to stay race-ready in autumn and winter, and for the rest of us to see what life is like as a ball bearing.</p> <p>If, like me, you’re having a lifelong love affair with adrenaline, then it’s glorious. If, like me, you recently got such a heavy concussion from falling off a borrowed bike that you lost all sense of smell, then it can also be gloriously nerve-racking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4df601669567b69987a63bde77f845c83781307d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414136325563/42aca603-890a-477d-ab19-cf312511acaf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nell registers at Redbridge cycling centre.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nell registers at Redbridge cycling centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am a keen cyclist in the sense that I am keen to never go anywhere near public transport. I cycle about 100km a week, all year round, wheeling to work through hail storms and baking sunshine, and treating those two imposters just the same. A bit of heavy braking, white-knuckle freewheeling and thigh-grinding hill climbing is gruelling, if not completely unfamiliar.</p> <p>I’ll admit that, as I cycled into the <a href=\"http://redbridgecyclingcentre.co.uk/\">Redbridge cycling centre</a>, having set off an hour earlier from my flat 12 miles away, I was thrilled to see that there were people on the course with shorter legs than mine, even if they were children and had apparently been born in the saddle: cyclocross is definitely a family affair, with races for children, teens, women, seniors and veterans. There were bobble-hatted teenagers, the inevitable competitive fathers, women with blue rinses, coffee-sipping mothers and cheerleading children lining the route, soaking up the unexpected autumn sunshine.</p> <p>I was entering the women’s race; by far the smallest group, just eight strong-legged ladies and myself lining up for the starting bell. Did my fellow competitors have any final words of advice for this novice?</p> <p>“Just enjoy it,” said the woman on my right. “Go at your own pace, don’t let them push you around and remember, it’s inclusive. You’ve got just as much right to be here as anyone else.” I could have kissed her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a70cf431b5eed4c96cd4f4c5045d514c92b0740\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414136504198/3bf58fc1-e665-4806-aebb-ec30f15e23e5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Riders on the Redbridge course.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riders on the Redbridge course.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In order that my first lap of the race wasn’t cycled blind, I’d spent a few minutes earlier going round the track, checking out the twists and dips; the obstacles and tight corners. Suffice to say I still fell off, sliding on some greasy nettles while trying to turn an 80 degree angle downhill.</p> <p>I practised dismounting and shouldering my bike to climb over some wooden hurdles; I ran out of steam halfway up a camel hump, skidding into a patch of brambles as I bumped over a ditch, and I nearly lost my way along the threads of white ribbon marking out the course.</p> <p>I also discovered that when a rider coming up behind you shouts “Left!” it doesn’t mean they want you to move left, but that they’re coming up on your left. Sometimes they shout “Inside!” or “Outside!” as you go around a corner and sometimes they simply scream “Rider! Rider!” to let you know that someone with legs of iron is screaming up behind you.</p> <p>Despite the rocketing levels of adrenaline and testosterone, cyclocross is actually an exceptionally friendly sport. Everyone I spoke to offered me advice and support and, once the race had started, the track was lined with strangers shouting the kind of encouragement usually found in the titles of a self-help library; “Don’t look back!”, “Go for it!” “Don’t be scared – be fast!” There was even a young girl with a bell, sitting on a grassy bank, ringing each lap and calling out encouragement to every rider.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb2cbf0f7510a11adc88633db8d36625dc7293c4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414136609749/e3b818cc-2db5-4fd1-ac84-e9be4e9399d9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nell is elated and exhausted after her first cyclocross race.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nell is elated and exhausted after her first cyclocross race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The race lasted 40 minutes. I was lapped by the winner of the women’s round and overtaken by so many veteran men that at times I felt I had the whole course to myself. My heart soared, my confidence grew and, as I got to know the course, I started to whizz through on a wave of exhilaration. While my race time will not bother the history books, I don’t think I actually came last and, when that final chequered flag waved, I could happily have carried on for a few more laps.</p> <p>But instead I sat in the sunshine, drank a cup of tea, ate a banana, and watched the men wheel by.</p> <p><em>Follow the <a href=\"http://viciousvelo.blogspot.co.uk/\">Vicious Velo blog</a> for details of its next event</em></p> <h2>Three places to try or watch cyclocross<br /></h2> <p><strong>The </strong><a href=\"http://www.whiteleywoods.org.uk/\"><strong>Whiteley Wood Outdoor Centre</strong></a>, in the Peak District near Sheffield, will host the Yorkshire Points Round 8 on 23 November.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mbwales.com/en/content/cms/Centres/Coed_y_Brenin/Coed_y_Brenin.aspx\"><strong>Coed Y Brenin </strong></a><strong> </strong>in Wales is a cyclists’ dream.

Although he covered many aspects of the entertainment industry – including theatre, music-hall and cabaret – and had two left feet, dance was his passion. His particular loves were contemporary and ballet, but his expertise encompassed styles as diverse as clog, tap, aerial and hip-hop.</p> <p>Kevin was born in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, son of Jessica and Harold. His father had been a Butlin’s Redcoat and then worked at the Sheffield Telegraph and the Sheffield Star as circulation manager and head of sales. Kevin got his first typewriter at four and always wanted to be a journalist, but his father said he wasn’t tough enough. So he trained as a teacher and started writing in his spare time. It wasn’t until he was 50 that he was able to take it up full-time.</p> <p>He began by writing for the Dalesman in the 1980s, doing pieces for its Yorkshire Humour short stories. He covered local races for Cycling Weekly, and one July nearly froze in snowy weather reporting on the Tour de France stage at Val-d’Isère. Kevin wrote for the Yorkshire Post, the Times Saturday supplement and the TES (Times Educational Supplement) and contributed to Child Education magazine.</p> <p>Living in the remote Yorkshire village of Airton did not hinder him, and in May 1993 Kevin did his first review for <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/author/kevin-berry/\" title=\"\">the Stage</a>. He travelled all over the north to submit reviews and features, and went on to become one of the paper’s longest-standing and most prolific contributing editors and dance specialists. He was one of the first regional reviewers to be admitted to the Critics’ Circle.</p> <p>Having written for the Stage’s Showpeople interview column since 1996, he edited both that and its 60-Second CV column from September 2007 until May this year, and was also the paper’s scholarships and dance supplements editor. I wrote for him for almost seven years and he was a dream editor. His final interview appeared in May and, fittingly, his last feature – on Ghost Peloton by Phoenix Dance – combined his loves of dance and cycling.</p> <p>He was also the northern dance correspondent for Dancing Times and Dance Today for many years.</p> <p>Kevin was a committed Quaker and a true family man. He was smitten on meeting Pat Young at college in 1967, and they married four years later.

They are incredibly capable professionals and I consider them an asset for any team as they come with tremendous motivation and great experience.”</p> <p>Yates said: “[It is] an honour to be asked by Bjarne to join Tinkoff-Saxo.

Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure>  <p>With less than 14km of individual time trialling, next year’s Tour makes a real break with tradition. Gone is the 50+km “race of truth”. It seems no modern rider will ever have the opportunity to replicate Raymond Impanis, who won a 139km time trial in 1947 – the longest in the Tour’s history. Instead, in what looks suspiciously like the Vueltaisation of the Tour (the Amaury Sport Organisation organise both races) the individual test has had to give way to a series of tough mountain challenges. Five of the seven high mountain stages will finish in the clouds. And there are newcomers too – the climb of La Pierre Saint-Martin hits gradients of 15% over its 25km length and the Montvernier ascends a steep 4km up a cliff face in 18 torturous hairpin bends.</p> <p>But as Christian Prudhomme was announcing the 2015 <em>parcours</em> among glitter cannons and illuminated bicycles in Paris, <a href=\"http://www.chris-froome.com/news/40-2015-tour-de-france\">Chris Froome was busy putting a bomb</a> under the entire event. Notable by his absence in the Palais des Congrès, the 2013 winner instead released a statement on his website <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/22/chris-froome-may-not-participate-2015-tour-de-france\">hinting that he might not ride the 2015 race at all</a>. Despite not attending the presentation, Team Sky had managed to steal the headlines after all.</p> <p>Instead of riding the French Tour, Froome suggested he that he was considering riding the Giro before heading to Spain for a tilt at the Vuelta. It’s a double that only three riders have ever achieved: Eddy Merckx, Giovanni Battaglin and Alberto Contador. The task is easier these days with the Giro and Vuelta bookending the Tour. In Merckx and Battaglin’s day, when the Vuelta preceded the Giro, it was arguably the hardest double of them all, with the two races virtually running into each other in April and May.</p> <p>For Froome, a focus on the <a href=\"http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/giro-ditalia-2015-route-revealed-138875\">2015 Giro</a> makes perfect sense. After the 17km opening team time trial, a discipline in which Sky have shown decent form, there sits at the heart of the race a perfectly formed, pan-flat individual time trial – 59.2km of pain running from Treviso to Valdobbiadene – where Froome would hope to force an advantage over expected rivals such as Contador and Vincenzo Nibali, who are both making noises about a Giro-Tour double in 2015, and defending champion Nairo Quintana. Froome is no Tony Martin – though he came close to matching the imperious German in the 2013 Tour – but relative to the other GC contenders, he is a Bradley Wiggins against the clock.</p> <p>The Kenyan-born British rider – the first cyclist born on the African continent to carry off the sport’s greatest prize – has undergone a curious transformation in the media. From the silent assassin of La Toussuire – where he seemed on the verge of attacking his Yellow Jersey clad team leader, Bradley Wiggins – to the peerless all-rounder of 2013 who simply rode away from the best climbers in the world with an extraordinary, seated attack on Mont Ventoux, to a kind of Cadel Evans figure, with a better time trial than most but one who must climb at his own pace to stay in contention. His press release suggests he needs a time trial to give him an edge over the climbers, but many fans and sponsors will be hoping that Froome is merely bluffing. That the mind games that surround any Grand Tour have already begun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"134db55f585751696348ef1a172ff297b7dc09b9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/29/1414579679427/99b48153-053c-43ee-a32d-2a4bbd4790f5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Froome\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Froome at the Tour de France 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Photosport Int/REX/Photosport Int</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will it work against Contador? Unlikely – the Spaniard weathered the 2009 Tour when the master of psychological warfare, Lance Armstrong, unleashed the full arsenal of his dark arts against his team-mate. Nibali was criticised by team boss Alexander Vinokourov in an email that went viral. He came back and won the Tour de France. Perhaps only Quintana is vulnerable. Raised like a precious hot house flower by his Movistar team, he has been kept away from the pressure cooker of the Tour since 2013, when he finished second to Froome. But he won this year’s Giro in controversial circumstances, after appearing to ignore signals to neutralise the descent on the stormy Stelvio.</p> <p>If Contador and Nibali are serious about <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/cycling/news/22854/9520095/oleg-tinkov-exclusive-qa\">taking up Oleg Tinkov on his indecent proposal</a> – he’s offering €1m to the top four GC riders, Contador, Nibali, Quintana and Froome to take on all three Grand Tours next season – they will need to have spent some quality time in the wind tunnel refining their time trialling technique. The Giro pivots on that time trial stage – those less adept in the art of riding against the clock will have to deliver a tricky balancing act between burning their matches in the mountains and conserving energy for the race of truth and the final uphill tests before the Maglia Rosa rests on the shoulders of the eventual winner in Milan.</p> <p> And with a scant 34 days before the Tour de France starts in Utrecht, it would take a rider with supremer mental and physical strength to navigate the challenges of a first week that looks like a compacted Spring Classics season, culminating in a later than usual team time trial on stage 9. As Contador says: “It will be important not to have lost riders in crashes or from illness, because a stage like this will be different if you have lost two riders in contrast to having a full team ready.” </p> <p>The challengers for the Tour 2015 will be under no illusion that, as ever in the modern era, the rider with the best team and the best recovery will take the Yellow Jersey in Paris. But great climbers have won in the past as much for their ability against the clock as for their talent to fly when the air thins and the big men struggle. In 1958, Charly Gaul, “the Angel of the Mountains”, won every time trial in the race, on the flat and in the mountains – a total of 141km alone against the clock – and Frederico Bahamontes, “the Eagle of Toledo”, took only one stage in winning the 1959 Tour. But it was the 12km test up the Puy de Dome, the volcanic dome that rises from the meadows of the Auvergne. Bahamontes turned the GC upside down, climbing to within four seconds of the lead and hammering home the nail two days later when he pulled on the race leader’s jersey.</p> <p>Tinkov’s €1m challenge may seem meaningless when Froome and his peers pull in multimillion contracts a year. But the romance of the Double can attract riders. Bradley Wiggins was lured by it, attempting the 2013 Giro before being forced to pull out through a combination of bad health, bad weather and bad luck. As a great student of the sport and its history, Wiggins was keen to line up alongside the seven riders – Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Stephen Roche, Miguel Indurain and Marco Pantani – who have worn both the Maglia Rosa and the Maillot Jaune in the same season.</p> <p>No rider has ever achieved the result Tinkov’s million Euro prize is designed to produce: a Triple Crown of Grand Tour wins. Merckx and Roche came closest, taking the Double and then going on to pull on the Rainbow Stripes of World Champion. Only two riders have ever finished in the top 10 of all three Grand Tours in the same season: France’s Raphael Geminiani in 1955 and Italy’s Gastone Nocentini, who won the 1957 Giro and finished sixth in the Tour and ninth in the Vuelta. Merckx, Hinault and Contador have held all three titles within 12 months – with Merckx going one better, as ever, and taking four Grand Tours back to back, winning the Tour and the Vuelta between his 1972 and 1973 Giro triumphs.</p> <p>Tinkov argues it can be done – he cites Adam Hansen’s current streak of participating in 10 Grand Tours back-to-back – but Hansen is a domestique, a workhorse with only thoughts of occasional stage glory and hauling his body around Italy, France and Spain at the service of his leader. To stay at the highest competitive level, and to be truly competitive at that level physiologically and psychologically, takes a special kind of rider – one that may not have existed since Bernard Hinault hung up his cleats.</p> <p>But the Tour de France remains, for good or ill, the biggest draw in the cycling calendar. It’s the race the biggest teams and the best riders, and the all-important sponsors want to be there. It was the focus of Sir Dave Brailsford’s Sky team at its inception and he retains ambitions for reclaiming the crown in the future – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jul/11/team-sky-dave-brailsford-british-cyclists-tour-de-france\">perhaps even with a French rider</a>. It’s a curious race this year, a tour of two Frances – the north and the south – with precious little in between. The north is the rough, tough cycling of the hard men, the flahutes, with its cobbles and its crosswinds and its famously variable weather. It’s the cycling of the Hell of the North and the Ardennes and the Fleche Wallonne with its iconic finish on the Mur de Huy, that deceptive little climb that ramps up to 26%, its 1,300m seemingly endless. It’s the cycling of granite-hard Brittany, that wild and windswept landscape that produced so many of the greatest cyclists from Jean Robic to Louison Bobet. It’s the land of the Badger, and Hinault will be delighted to see the Tour back on his home roads.</p> <p>The race heads south after a finish on the Mûr de Bretagne, the Alpe d’Huez of Brittany, and towards the next great rendezvous in the Pyrenees. This is the France of barren and breathtaking peaks, of the Circle of Death – the Col d’Aubisque, Col du Soulor, Col du Tourmalet, Col d’Aspin and Col de Peyresourde – where the wind screams and the snow falls even in summer. <br /></p> <p>Nibali will be hoping for a repeat of the form that took him to an imperious win at Hautacam this year. It’s Contador’s favourite playground and he’ll be looking for a repeat of his 2007 win on the Plateau de Beille. Froome took his first ever Tour victory here at Ax-3-Domaines. The first rider over the Tourmalet on stage 11, as the race heads to a hilltop finish in Cauterets, will pass le Geant, the monumental statue that honours Octave Lapize – the first man ever to crest the summit – and receive the Souvenir Jacques Goddet. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d5341eca9429b4513d40ad7abab8b9249a1a10d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/29/1414579916730/2a496374-f02d-44be-b148-f9ec160bc4d5-460x434.jpeg\" alt=\"Contador\" width=\"460\" height=\"434\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alberto Contador winning the Tour in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL New / Reuters/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A series of tough transition stages, built for the rouleurs and sprinters take the peloton east to the Alps, where Pra-Loup, la Toussuire and the Alpe d’Huez wait to decide the final destination of the Yellow Jersey. Merckx finally surrendered his Tour invincibility at Pra-Loup. Pierre Rolland signalled the French renaissance when he won at La Toussuire in 2012 with Thibaut Pinot leading home the rest of the race favourites. And the 21 lacets of the Alpe have seen some of the greatest moments in Tour history; Peter Winnen, one of the many Dutch winners on what has become the Dutch mountain said the Alpe had taken five years off his life. It’s not the prettiest or hardest mountain out there but the penultimate stage of the race – at a swift 110km, it’s being billed as “100km of drama!” – might just see a rider pinch the Tour from under the leader’s nose, as Carlos Sastre did in 2008 when he overhauled team-mate Frank Schleck to take the Yellow Jersey and hold it to Paris. </p> <p>But we still won’t see the best women in the world duking it out in the big mountains. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2014/may/12/alfonsina-strada-giro-italia-woman-grand-tour\">La Course</a> is back on the Champs Elysees, a tasty warm-up to the finale of the Tour on that hallowed boulevard. The Vuelta are making noises about running a similar one-day race on the last stage of the 2015 event. There are encouraging reports that <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/10/news/news-aso-looking-american-sponsor-womens-tour-de-france_348306\">ASO are looking for an American sponsor</a> for a week-long women’s stage race to take place over some of the same stages as the men’s race. But not this year.</p> <p>A mountainous <em>parcours</em> with plenty for the sprinters and the puncheurs. The pendulum has swung away from the seeming sterility of the lengthy solo effort to the old days of sweat and grit. To riders going <em>mano a mano</em>, playing chess on wheels at 6,000 feet. Contador and Quintana will be desperate to leave their names on one of the 21 hairpins of the Alpe; Nibali will want to defend his crown and prove that he deserved his 2014 title. Whether any or all of them come into the Tour in a position to try for that elusive, extraordinary Double and take home some or all of Tinkov’s million dollar jackpot remains to be seen. As for Froome, the decision to skip the Tour may be out of his hands – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/23/brian-cookson-uci-president-team-sky-abandoning-british-development-sir-dave-brailsford\">Brailsford is under attack from Brian Cookson</a> for failing to develop British talent and sponsors may leave him no option. </p> <p>They don’t call the Tour <em>La Petite Reine</em> for nothing.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://100tours100tales.wordpress.com/\">This article appeared first on 100 Tours 100 Tales</a><br />• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/festinagirl\">Follow Suze Clemitson on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Follow Guardian Sport on Facebook</a></strong></p>","headline":"Tour de France 2015: what the route means for the main contenders","trailText":"Nairo Quintana and Alberto Contador will be excited by a race that suits climbers, but Chris Froome might not complete at all<br>• Route takes in Utrecht start and Alpe d’Huez hairpins","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/29/1414579489568/5353a0eb-99ed-4624-a805-041621a99272-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"2371","commentable":"true","byline":"Suze Clemitson for 100 Tours 100 Tales, part of the Guardian Sport Network","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-01T11:15:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2014/oct/29/tour-de-france-2015-route-froome-quintana-contador-froome","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2014/oct/29/tour-de-france-2015-route-froome-quintana-contador-froome","tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/series/guardian-sport-network","webTitle":"Guardian Sport Network","description":"The Guardian Sport Network brings you a selection of the best comment from our partners across the web","type":"series","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network","references":[]},{"id":"sport/100-tours-100-tales","webTitle":"100 Tours 100 Tales","description":"My personal take on the beautiful, murky soap opera that is professional bike racing","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales","references":[]},{"id":"sport/alberto-contador","webTitle":"Alberto Contador","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/alberto-contador","references":[]},{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/chris-froome","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/suze-clemitson","webTitle":"Suze Clemitson","r2ContributorId":"60055","firstName":"suze","lastName":"clemitson","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Suze Clemitson is the author of <a href=\"http://velocast.cc/100-tours-100-tales\">100 Tours 100 Tales</a> and the blog of the same name.

It has become an issue because of the popularity of cycling – in a way it takes headlines and awful accidents to really get the attention of the people that can make these decisions that can improve the environment for cycling,\" he said.</p><p>\"I remember [former Olympic champion] Chris Boardman saying change is painful and takes time and it's not going to be an easy process and I think he's absolutely right. To get to the stage where we're like Holland, Denmark or Germany where cycling is integrated into road provision, where there are plans put into place for cycling, where there are bike paths, junctions that are thoughtful for all traffic users, that will take time.\"</p><p>A huge surge in cycling popularity in recent years has resulted in almost half of the British population now owning a bike, more than 3 million people cycling at least three times a week and 750,000 people commuting to work on bikes, up from 90,000 in 2001, according to the census.</p><p>Hoy, who was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/chris-hoy-more-cyclists-will-die-before-action-is-taken-by-mps-9537545.html\" title=\"\">speaking to the Independent on Sunday</a> at the launch of his own range of bikes, said  the conversation had changed as cycling safety moved up the agenda.</p><p>\"When the people in power realise the benefits of cycling in terms of reducing congestion and improving the health of the nation it seems like an obvious thing to do – but then I'm a cyclist. You want everyone – cyclists and drivers – to get from A to B as safely as possible,\" he said. \"Just the very fact that it's being discussed in the national press is a good start – we are getting somewhere but there is still a massive way to go.</p><p>\"We are a very congested small island, but all the more reason to putting cycling at the forefront. We can reduce the number of other vehicles on the road and get more bikes on the road.\"</p><p>In 2012, more than 3,200 cyclists were seriously injured on the road. There were 122 deaths including 13 children – a five-year high.

It's not to say he couldn't win it with Bradley, absolutely not, all teams would be crying out for someone like Bradley on their team but Dave has made that call with Chris Froome and the team around Chris that he feels can best support him to win the tour.

Never can a nation have been more grateful. Gerry Adams's arrest last week in connection to a notorious Troubles-era murder may have convulsed the media and political establishment, but for weeks now, in parts of the province, conversation has focused around \"the Giro\" and how best to prepare for it.</p><p>In Ballyhackamore, east Belfast, past which the riders will pedal twice on Friday evening's opening time trial event, several cafes, the hairdresser, optician's and even surveyor's office have pink window displays declaring \"Benvenuti\". The village of Bushmills, on the coastal route for Stage 2 on Saturday, has been festooned with pink bunting and chequered pink flags, while the village butcher has painted a cyclist on its window being chased by one of its home-bred Charolais bulls, which you can buy inside ready-filleted.</p><p>The cricket club in Armagh, through which the race will pass on Sunday's cross-border Stage 3, finishing in Dublin, has been given permission from the Northern Cricket Union to play in pink, rather than the regulation white.

Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>For Northern Ireland, still struggling to establish a post-Troubles identity 16 years after the Good Friday Agreement, a cycling race broadcast to 165 countries (and a potential audience of up to 800 million people) is a very big deal indeed – even if, with Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish giving the Giro a miss in favour of the Tour de France, only a tiny proportion of spectators will be able to name a single competitor.</p><p>\"This is the biggest event we have ever had in Northern Ireland,\" says Ross who, as private secretary to Arlene Foster, the province's trade and investment minister, was part of the initial delegation that travelled to Italy in 2012 to woo race organisers RCS Sport.</p><p>Last year's G8 conference, held in County Fermanagh, brought the world's news media to the province, \"but it wasn't something that local people got involved in,and it wasn't something everyone would necessarily be near. This race covers so much of Northern Ireland geographically and allows so many people to interact with it.\"</p><p>The Northern Ireland government paid £3m for the right to host the event, says Ross, and committed to a promotional campaign to support it. \"But already in terms of publicity we have had more than 10 times that in return.\"</p><p>But for all the enthusiasm, this is a part of the world where even the most carnivalesque parade has a capacity to turn political. There was early discontent when the race route was announced when it became apparent that while (mostly Protestant) east Belfast was well served, much of (mostly Catholic) west Belfast would be bypassed by the riders. \"What we will see is all other parts of the city being touched and being seen worldwide except west Belfast, and it is just not good enough,\" said local Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey.</p><p>Representatives from south Down, also a majority Catholic area, were similarly aggrieved that the race would bypass the Mourne mountain area.</p><p>Ross says the final decision on the route was taken by RCS Sport – it was their decision, for instance, to take the time trial up the steep mile-long driveway to the parliament buildings at Stormont –  but that \"from a tourism point of view we just wanted to make sure our main tourist locations were shown off\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-436122411'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399310539957/Giro-dItalia-009.jpg' alt='Giro d'Italia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A tractor and bicycle have been painted pink on the Giro d'Italia 2014 route via the Causeway Coastal Route. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>More serious was a bitter dispute over paramilitary murals, several of which will be passed by the riders along the route. Politicians from all parties struck a deal in February to remove campaign posters for the local and European elections from the route, in order to show the province \"in the best possible light\". But when Anna Lo, an assembly member for the cross-community Alliance party, suggested murals showing masked gunmen could also be painted over, she was met with a furious response that included, from some quarters, vicious racist abuse (Lo was born in Hong Kong and is a longstanding campaigner for ethnic minorities in the province).</p><p>East Belfast has an Alliance MP, Naomi Long, but after the party voted with nationalists to stop the union jack being flown every day from Belfast's city hall, sparking protests in December 2012, it is wildly unpopular in the area's loyalist estates. Last Tuesday evening, the party's Newtownards Road constituency office, past which the riders will cycle on Friday, was firebombed. The large pink cycle in the office window on the morning following the attacks was accompanied by panelling over the broken windows and scorch marks.</p><p>\"The abuse I have got [since the flags protest] is taking a toll,\" says Lo. \"I have a lot of really foul abuse, really degrading abuse online. I have been having threats made against me, picked up by the police. There was also a spent bullet and a photograph of me sent to a Sunday paper. My stand is still the same, that I am not going to be silenced by the bullies, but it is relentless.\"</p><p>She doesn't regret her comments on the murals on the race route, however. \"Not at all, no. I stand by it. It's a great occasion for Northern Ireland to showcase what a beautiful place it is and that we have moved past the days of the Troubles. But there is still a small element of people here who are stuck in the past and only really concerned about sectarian politics.  Many local people themselves don't like the murals, she says, but fear intimidation if they speak out.</p><p>\"The first time we heard anything about the Giro was when Anna Lo popped up to say 'We don't want these images of paramilitarism being displayed around the world',\" says David Stitt. The former loyalist prisoner who now runs Charter NI, a community organisation promoting education and peacebuilding among working class Protestant communities He condemns the firebombing and abuse directed at Lo, but passionately disagrees with her. \"Those murals have been there for 25 years. To us, that's part of our culture. The conflict is part of our history here and you just can't airbrush it away.\"</p><p>As he notes, the murals are themselves a major tourist attraction, even if locals benefit little from the tour buses that frequently pause outside his office window, which is also on the race route.</p><p>\"The Giro d'Italia coming through here, it's a good start. But it'll showcase in this area the fact that there's no infrastructure here,\" says Stitt, who claims the tourist and business development at the Titanic quarter, in the east Belfast docklands that were once this area's major employers, have seen millions spent in their area from which local people are effectively locked out. More work needs to be done, he says, to ensure the dividends of the peace process reach the communities that were worst affected by the Troubles.</p><p>And yet, despite inevitable bumps in the road, the race's arrival in the province represents progress that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago, according to Ross. After passing the heart of loyalist east Belfast, where the Presbyterian church has hoisted a bright pink cycle at its front window, the riders will race to the Catholic Lower Ormeau Road, passing the memorial to five people shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries in 1992.

The laws of France cease to operate. The gendarmes are there not to enforce the laws of the state but the laws of the tour. Goddet can perform marriages like a sea captain. No one, not even de Gaulle, would dare raise his voice in anger if Goddet shot down a Russian or American who had violated his air space.\" He said it in jest before a leg of the Tour and after following it for a day, I believe him.</p><p>Jacques Goddet, executive director of <em>L'Equipe</em>, stood in his long British colonial shorts with a toupee on his Alec Guinness head, administrating the start of the night stage of the Tour with the calm of a district commissioner receiving a tribal delegation. Journalists gazed at him through mouthfuls of seafood and Muscadet, admiring the man who had conceived and modernised the Tour, which an American journalist once described as the best piece of organisation since the North African landings.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411915571'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372341315690/jacques-goddet-001.jpg' alt='jacques goddet' width='200' height='198' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France and founder of the daily newspaper L'Equipe. Photograph: Gamma-Keystone</figcaption></figure><p>At the off that strange whirring noise of 130 cyclists began to eat up the road to Bordeaux. Behind them, team cars covered with advertisements and spare bikes with their wheels spinning against a background of yacht masts in La Rochelle harbour and to the left of them a stampeding horde of journalists and photographers. Goddet's co-director leads the riders while he sits just behind, calling up the team cars to change a puncture – done at Le Mans speed – or hauling a red flag up his aerial to stop following cars from passing the cyclists when the road is too dangerous or narrow. It was always dangerous and mostly narrow. If there was no room to pass on the road, the cars mounted the pavements and gave the spectators a thrill by sandwiching them on the kerb.</p><p>Italian car horns blared through the peaceful French countryside and one was glad that the Protestant facade of La Rochelle had been rid of the all-conquering Latin vulgarity of the Tour.</p><p>The road runs arrow-like over the undulating East Anglia-esque flat lands by the Atlantic, before it turns inland through the Romanesque vineyards of the Gironde and on down to Bordeaux.</p><p>All of France seemed to be picnicking. Peasants hacked at bread and cheese or brought out antiquated telescopes, soldiers had the day off and while provincial bourgeoisie sat at their respectable tables, forks in their hands and transistors in their ears. For a journalist perhaps the greatest elation of all is the feeling known best to heads of state of riding a convertible, standing up on the seat at full speed through the villages and acknowledging the cheering of women and children. General MacArthur on his recall from Korea.</p><p>If you looked behind at the straining hordes and incredible pace of the cyclists, you were soon deflated by their superlative physical condition; the brown, wind-polished limbs and the teamwork of getting a competitor back in the crowd as three of four team-mates slip-streamed the stricken rider from in front and the team car virtually pushed him from behind. The stage to Bordeaux is normally boring except that it is the last before the mountains and often won by a Dutchman. The Pyrenees, which lie ahead, will sort out the real competitors before they reach Barcelona on Saturday evening.</p><p>Nobody quite knows why the Dutch win at Bordeaux, perhaps the final effort of the \"platlanders\" before the Pyrenees or the celebration of arrival on familiar terrain after the Pyrenees – whichever way the Tour is run.</p><p>Of three Italians, young Felipe Gimondi is in the lead, with Adorni and Motta well placed. Some feel that Poulidor, the French favourite, who is now in second, has already won. Poulidor himself said: \"The mountains are our chance and we're going to seize it,\" he said. The Spaniards think otherwise. \"The Pyrenees,\" said the great climber Bahamontes, \"will be an entirely Spanish recital.\"</p><p><em>This is an edited extract</em></p>","headline":"From the Observer archive, 4 July 1965: The man who makes the Tour de France's wheels turn","trailText":"<p><strong>Andrew Mulligan</strong> watches Jacques Goddet preside over the annual national jamboree that is the Tour de France</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372335911794/Sunbathing-Tour-de-France-005.jpg","wordcount":"684","commentable":"true","byline":"Andrew Mulligan","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-27T11:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/france","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/agenda","webTitle":"Agenda","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","webTitle":"From the Observer archive","description":"Historic articles from the Observer archive.

Obree, described as a genius by Sir Chris Hoy, possessed huge natural talent and drive, but a series of factors – not least his refusal to touch the drugs then prevalent in the sport – cut short his career in the 1990s and he slipped into relative obscurity and intermittent depression.</p><p>Now at 47, he plans to try for the world human-powered land speed record on a machine which he rides head first, just above the ground. If that wasn't enough, the bike was almost entirely built in his kitchen from recycled parts, including metal from an old saucepan.</p><p>The idea that a self-built steel-framed creation, which Obree estimates cost around £1,000 to build, could tackle the 82.8 mph record set in 2009 by a Canadian rider using a computer-modelled, carbon fibre-shelled recumbent machine, seems ludicrous. But this is well-trodden ground for Obree, one of the more creative, bloody-minded and enigmatic characters in British sport.</p><p>The Ayrshire-based rider achieved fame from seemingly nowhere in July 1993 when he broke the world one-hour cycle distance record at a Norwegian velodrome, using a self-built bike, Old Faithful. This incorporated a self-created, highly aerodynamic tuck position as well as, famously, ballbearings borrowed from a washing machine.</p><p>Obree retook his record the following year, also winning a track world championship title on Old Faithful. When cycling's governing body, the UCI, outlawed the tuck stance, Obree came back with an equally creative alternative, the stretched out \"Superman\" position, to win another world title.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531352'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372165923377/Graeme-Obree-1996-Olympic-010.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree 1996 Olympics' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree competes during the preliminary round of the men's individual pursuit at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That was where it ended. It is arguably paradoxical to describe a man whose autobiography, The Flying Scotsman, was made into a film staring Jonny Lee Miller, as an unsung hero, but Obree never notched up the titles and fame of his peers, such as Chris Boardman.</p><p>Obree's sole Olympics, in 1996, saw him exit in the preliminary rounds. His career with a French professional road cycling team lasted one day. Obree has always maintained he was sacked when he made it clear he would not use drugs.</p><p>He has endured a turbulent personal life, affected by self-criticism and depression, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Obree came out as gay a couple of years ago, something he says has contributed to his happiness. His decision to do so is still relatively unusual in professional sport.</p><p>He reinvented himself as an author and a speaker, and just over two years ago began plotting an attempt at the human-powered bike speed record. Rather than adapt one of the feet-first recumbent bikes traditionally used for such bids, Obree, typically, started from scratch.</p><p>The result is the Beastie, in which the rider lies face down and head forward, with his or her feet powering a pair of narrower push-pull levers rather than conventional pedals.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531353'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372166249301/Graeme-Obree-001.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree' width='220' height='424' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree on the sea front in Ayrshire in 2007. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>\"The idea came from first principles,\" Obree said. \"The widest part of the body is the shoulders, so if you think about a teardrop shape it makes sense to have that at the front, and the feet‚ with the push-pull, meaning they just miss each other at the narrowest part, at the back.</p><p>\"The first thing I had to do was the basic outline of the structure. The body's the one thing you can't change. Everything else was built around that mechanically.\"</p><p>The Beastie was built mainly in Obree's small flat in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, with excursions to a friend's workshop. The steel frame came primarily from old bikes, and as many other components as possible were recycled. Stainless steel from an old saucepan became part of a shoulder rest.</p><p>Such a process was necessary, given the innovative design. Obree said: \"It was one of those things where I didn't know exactly what I wanted until I could see how it came into shape. If you're building it yourself you can make all the fine changes as you go along. If it's done by someone else, when it comes back you'll go: 'Oh, that's wrong,' and it could take weeks to fix. But doing it myself, in my own flat, the same process could take an hour.\"</p><p>Obree has tried out the machine once, wobbling to a modest 30mph or so on a runway at Prestwick airport, without the aerodynamic fairing, as he got used to the low-slung machine's twitchy ride. \"The main thing was, once I was launched I could hold a relatively straight line,\" he said. \"That's good to know. I'd say the test was pretty successful in terms of mechanical parts working. The skin's fine, the bike's steerable, nothing fell off.\"</p><p>In September Obree and the Beastie will decamp to a super-smooth, high altitude road in Nevada for the annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge. He is promising nothing. \"All I can do is go and give it a good punt,\" he said. However, a record would bring renewed recognition.</p><p>The temptation is to create a narrative in which this would be vindication for a man denied the celebrity of Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins thanks to petty officialdom and the endemic drug taking of early 1990s cycling. <a href=\"http://road.cc/content/news/36717-graeme-obree-interview-part-2-doping-olympics-uci-regulations-and-future-projects\" title=\"\">Obree, typically, doesn't see it that way</a>.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways I wouldn't like to be as famous as Bradley Wiggins. I think that would be totally awful, actually, getting stopped in the street everywhere. I get it occasionally but it's quite polite, it's nice. It's not a crowd of people around you, like Chris Hoy gets. I wouldn't want that level of fame.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, Obree says he is glad the post-Lance Armstrong cycling era is more ready to hear his story: \"I've got no regret about not taking drugs. But I obviously wonder how I'd have got on at the Tour de France. That was what I was lined up for. But that wasn't my overriding goal from the start, my goal was a world record, so I got that, and the world championships. The Olympics got away, obviously. And it would have been great to get Olympic gold and, say, a Tour de France stage win. But hey ho.</p><p>\"And you know what? I escaped with my health and my honour. In a lot of ways I don't have any regrets.\"</p><p></p><h2>An innovative man</h2><p>To get a sense of the extent to which Graeme Obree likes to re-think the very fundamentals of his sport, consider his self-penned 2012 training manual, The Obree Method. Inside is an entire chapter about how to adapt your breathing so as to absorb more oxygen (it's all to do with the out-breaths).</p><p>Craig MacLean, who competed on the velodrome for Britain at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, recalls first meeting Obree at track competitions in the early 1990s.</p><p>\"He thinks about everything in a very unconventional way. There's some ideas about training he gave me which I still use today. Cycling is almost like a big experiment for him.</p><p>\"He was a bit of a maverick around that era. Cycling was very much a traditional sport ‚you only ever rode fixed gear in the winter and you had to do a certain number of miles before you were allowed back on your normal road bike, all these things that had been around since the dark ages. But he always did things differently.\"</p>","headline":"Flying Scotsman Graeme Obree returns with beastly bid at another world record","trailText":"Cycling's unsung hero to take on human powered speed contest on the Beastie, which he built from recycled parts in his kitchen","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3gp28","wordcount":"1223","commentable":"true","byline":"Peter Walker","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-06-28T14:13:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/25/flying-scotsman-graeme-obree-cycling-beastie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/25/flying-scotsman-graeme-obree-cycling-beastie","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/world-records","webTitle":"World records","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-records","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/world-records","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"environment/bike-blog","webTitle":"Bike blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on all things cycling - in the UK and around the world","type":"blog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"world/world-records","webTitle":"World records","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world-records","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world-records","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"walker","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

Apologizing for disappointing them and putting the foundation at risk, Armstrong reportedly \"choked up\" during the meeting, and several other employees were in tears, too.</p><p>Armstrong told staffers he would try to restore Livestrong's reputation, and encouraged them to continue supporting the charity's mission to help cancer patients and their families.</p><p>Armstrong, a cancer survivor, founded Livestrong in 1997.

That's all I can say.\"</p><p>Winfrey's network OWN said Armstrong agreed to a \"no-holds-barred\" interview. \"Amstrong will address the alleged doping scandal, years of accusations of cheating and charges of lying about the use of performance-enhancing drugs throughout his storied cycling career,\" the network said in a statement.</p><p>The interview is set to air Thursday at 9pm eastern time in the US on the Oprah Winfrey Network and will be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/09/lance-armstrong-interview-oprah-winfrey\">streamed live internationally on Oprah.com.</a></p><p>Armstrong has continued to maintain his innocence, but is facing several legal challenges, and has lost millions of dollars in sponsorship deals and endorsements.

But as for so many other tarnished public figures, the journey of disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong will next week end opposite Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>Winfrey has confirmed that Armstrong, who in October was stripped of all his titles and labelled a \"serial drug cheat\" by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), will seek redemption on her show.</p><p>In a 90-minute interview from his home in Austin, Texas, he will speak publicly for the first time about the doping revelations that led to a lifetime ban from sport. It will be streamed live around the world on Oprah.com next Thursday as well as broadcast in the US at 2am UK time.</p><p>It is the first time Armstrong has given an interview since he lost his titles, was dropped by sponsors and pilloried by the public for his part in a doping conspiracy that spanned more than a decade and was described in excoriating detail in a 202-page report by Usada.</p><p>Within hours, bookmakers were offering odds on which words Armstrong would use in the interview, with Ladbrokes quoting 1-4 on \"apologise\" and evens on \"confess\". They were offering 8-11 on Armstrong breaking down in tears.</p><p>Travis Tygart, the Usada chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/19/travis-tygart-us-anti-doping-lance-armstrong\" title=\"\">told the Guardian in an interview last month</a> that he hoped an Armstrong confession could yet act as a powerful symbol for drug-free sport.</p><p>But others, including another former cycling drug cheat who has since become a respected anti-doping campaigner, immediately voiced concerns that a stage-managed talkshow was not the right forum to discuss claims that as recently as October Armstrong's lawyer was dismissing as a \"one-sided hatchet job\".</p><p>\"Only Lance would get to have his moment of truth, if that's what it will be, in front of Oprah Winfrey,\" said British cyclist David Millar, who was banned for two years in 2004 for injecting EPO at a time when doping was rife in the professional peloton.</p><p>\"It is not sitting in front of a judge or a disciplinary hearing being properly questioned about the things he has done wrong. I doubt very much it will be a proper interrogation,\" added Millar, who is a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency's athletes commission. \"My biggest concern is that it will be completely stage-managed, that he will just be 'given the ball', and that it will all be about his emotions rather that concentrating on exactly what he did wrong.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Oprah show said Armstrong was not being paid to appear and that Winfrey was free to ask any question she wanted. \"No payment for the interview. No editorial control, no question is off limits,\" the spokeswoman said in an email.</p><p>The Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), which will show the programme, is a joint venture between Winfrey's Harpo Productions and Discovery Channel. Discovery was the headline sponsor of Armstrong's team between 2004 and 2007.</p><p>It was that network's logo that was emblazoned on his shirt when he won his seventh Tour in 2005 and claimed it as a victory over \"the people that don't believe in cycling, the cynics and the sceptics\". Discovery was a vocal supporter of Armstrong and one of the last sponsors to distance itself from the Texan once Usada's damning evidence was published.</p><p>Former colleagues and rivals immediately began speculating on whether Armstrong would use the programme as a platform for contrition or an attempt to shift the blame. Armstrong had previously told a US tribunal that he had never used performance-enhancing drugs, opening up the possibility that he could perjure himself if he now admitted doping.</p><p>The Texan is at the centre of several ongoing legal disputes, while the Sunday Times is suing him for the repayment of a libel settlement the newspaper was forced to pay him over doping allegations.</p><p>Many fear Winfrey will give Armstrong an easy ride, recalling her interview with Olympic gold medallist Marion Jones, in which the weeping American sprinter claimed she took performance-enhancing drugs unintentionally.</p><p>Kathy LeMond, wife of the US Tour de France winner Greg, tweeted: \"@Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview.
