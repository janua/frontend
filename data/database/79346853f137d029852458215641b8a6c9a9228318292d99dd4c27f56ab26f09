The Bank of England governor indicated to Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight that interest rates wouldn't rise in the near future, despite unemployment falling to near the BoE's 7% threshold for considering a rise.</p><p>Carney is giving a speech at Davos just after midday. He seems to have stolen his own thunder by going on the telly the night before but let's see what he says.</p><p>Here's what CMC Markets' Michael Hewson makes of Carney's interview:<br></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Last night’s comments shouldn’t really have been a surprise given&nbsp;comments he made in November last year “one could imagine a scenario where the unemployment threshold is reached and that the best policy for the MPC at that period of time is to keep rates at current levels because the trade-off between output and inflation is attractive,” he said. With inflation now at 2% the Bank is clearly playing that trade-off.</p></blockquote><p>Away from the glamour of Davos,&nbsp;<b>Martin Weale</b>, an external member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, has been checking out the local economy in Suffolk.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eadt.co.uk/business/suffolk_no_early_rise_in_interest_rates_on_the_cards_says_mpc_member_martin_weale_1_3237989\">The East Anglian Daily Times reports</a>&nbsp;that Weale, who voted against Carney's forward guidance plan, doesn't want the MPC to revise its criteria for considering a rate rise. There are no quotes from Weale in the story but this is what the paper reports:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>﻿There have been suggestions the MPC should now lower the 7% threshold to, perhaps, 6.5%, but Mr Weale said he did not believe this would achieve the core aim of Forward Guidance, that of creating greater certainty, as any new threshold could also quickly be overtaken by events.&nbsp;However, he said the MPC had been clear all along that the unemployment rate was only one of many factors which would shape any decision to raise interest rates and, with wage increases still well below inflation, there was scope for rates to remain at their current level for a while yet.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting stuff, especially after Carney's interview and fellow MPC member&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/23/interest-rate-rise-undermine-recovery-mpc-paul-fisherhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/23/interest-rate-rise-bank-of-england\">Paul Fisher's speech yesterday</a>&nbsp;when he said he couldn't see an \"immediate need\" to increase rates.

After the Great Moderation and the Great Recession, there are several reasons why it will be years before any superlatives are attached to this recovery.\"</p><p>Carney said overall debt burdens of advanced countries had increased since the crisis, the global economy remained unbalanced and confidence remained fragile.</p><p>But he said policymakers had avoided the mistakes made during the 1930s and there was a chance that a new wave of innovations would lead to a new era of growth, following the pattern of the post second world war boom.</p><p>\"Protectionism is being resisted, banks recapitalised, and the global financial system rebuilt. In parallel, monetary policy is highly accommodative,\" he said.</p><p>\"As the global economy gains momentum, staying the course on these policies will be decisive to achieving escape velocity. The United Kingdom is at the centre of these decisions.\"</p><p>Carney admitted that unemployment had fallen faster than predicted since August when the Bank set a 7% jobless rate as the threshold for considering higher interest rates.</p><p>\"The latest data show that more than a quarter of a million jobs were created in a three-month period – the biggest increase since records began in 1971. As a result, unemployment seems to be falling at a pace that will reach our 7% threshold materially earlier than we had expected.\"</p><p>Many City economists expect unemployment to hit 7% within the next couple of months, but Carney said this would not lead to rates being raised from 0.5%, where they have been since early 2009.</p><p>\"Crucially, unemployment remains above the level that is likely to be consistent with maintaining inflation at the target in the medium term. It is not just that nearly three quarters of a million more people are out of work than before the crisis; another three quarters of a million more people are involuntarily working part time.\"</p><p>Giving a clear signal that he favoured amending forward guidance to take account of the improving labour market, the governor said: \"It now seems likely that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation in the medium term is somewhat lower than the MPC assessed back in August.</p><p>\"In part that is because rates of transition into jobs, even for those who have been unemployed for more than a year, have been sustained at high rates, minimising the extent of skill atrophy. In addition, other measures of slack in the labour market, such as involuntary part-time working remain high.</p><p>\"This suggests that, even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of monetary policy. It is widely recognised that our 7% threshold is not a trigger for raising Bank Rate.\"</p><p>Carney said that when the Bank announced forward guidance it made clear that the 7% unemployment threshold was not an interest-rate trigger.</p><p>\"The MPC will consider a range of options to update our guidance, recognising both what we have learned about the behaviour of aggregate supply in the economy as well as the more benign inflation outlook.\"</p>","headline":"UK economy well short of escape velocity, Mark Carney tells Davos","trailText":"Bank of England governor pledges that 'path of interest rates will be consistent with sustained recovery'","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6bt","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564135189/Mark-Carney-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564135189/Mark-Carney-006.jpg","wordcount":"757","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427929462","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601208","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Larry Elliott and Jill Treanor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032038","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T12:26:18Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/uk-economy-escape-velocity-mark-carney-interest-rates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/24/uk-economy-escape-velocity-mark-carney-interest-rates","tags":[{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/interest-rates","webTitle":"Interest rates","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/interest-rates","references":[]},{"id":"business/bankofenglandgovernor","webTitle":"Bank of England","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos-2014","webTitle":"Davos 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos-2014","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos","webTitle":"Davos","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos","references":[]},{"id":"profile/larryelliott","webTitle":"Larry Elliott","rcsId":"GNL001696","r2ContributorId":"15965","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/larry_elliott_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Larry Elliott is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics\">economics</a> editor and has been with the paper since 1988</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/larryelliott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/larryelliott","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jilltreanor","webTitle":"Jill Treanor","rcsId":"GNL003510","r2ContributorId":"15822","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jill_treanor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jill Treanor is the Guardian's City editor.

Only elitism kept him away from the top job for so long.</p><p>Scholey joined the board of British Steel in 1973, when he also became chief executive. From 1976 he also served as deputy chairman of the board, first to Sir Monty Finniston, probably the most cerebral of all British Steel chairmen, and later to an old Etonian, Sir Charles Villiers, whom Scholey despised, perhaps unfairly. Then he was deputy to Sir Ian MacGregor, whose judgment he mistrusted. Even when MacGregor moved to the National Coal Board in 1983 and most observers assumed Scholey would replace him, he was not moved up to chairman. This time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/04/guardianobituaries\" title=\"Guardian: Lord Haslam of Bolton obituary\">Sir Robert (later Lord) Haslam</a> got the job, doubling up as part-time chairman of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tateandlyle\" title=\"\">Tate and Lyle</a>.</p><p>Senior civil servants lobbied against appointing Scholey, believing he would be too abrasive as chairman at a time when huge cuts were needed in preparation for privatisation. But Haslam quickly recognised Scholey's value and effectively handed him the job of running the industry, finally persuading the prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"Guardian: Margaret Thatcher obituary\">Margaret Thatcher</a>, to override civil service objections and appoint Scholey.</p><p>By now approaching retirement age, Scholey flexed his muscles in the runup to privatisation, which took place two years later. He had never disguised his support for Thatcher's objective of selling off the steel industry, though he would have preferred it to have been handled rather differently.</p><p>By the time of the flotation at the end of 1988, Scholey had turned a loss-making industry into one that was turning a £500m-a-year profit. When there was a 13-week strike in 1980 – Thatcher's first major industrial test – there were more than 200,000 steelworkers. As Scholey took over as chairman, the workforce was down to about 60,000, and at privatisation the figure was 50,000.</p><p>The cutbacks were ruthless – similar in many ways to those imposed on the coal industry. In some circles Scholey was demonised for closing the huge Ravenscraig steelworks in Lanarkshire, a symbolic landmark. But he and the government claimed the cuts were necessary to turn British Steel into an internationally competitive force. By the time he retired in 1992 he had chalked up large profits for six of his seven years as chairman. Output had fallen to 12m tonnes a year when he retired, from 27m tonnes in 1967. But the business had become one of the most profitable steel groups in the world.</p><p>Behind Scholey's brusque carapace lay a keen and sensitive intellect with a fascination for classical history, a special interest in the Napoleonic period, a passion for Etruscan art, and above all a devotion to opera, notably Wagner. As he grew older he became increasingly attracted to foreign languages, taught himself French and read two French newspapers before any in English. In his retirement he and his wife, Joan Methley, whom he married in 1946, spent much time touring the sites of ancient Greek, Roman and north African civilisations.</p><p>It would have been tempting to view Scholey as a working-class lad who had hauled himself up by his bootstraps. Yet he was the son of middle-class professional parents and his father, Harold, was a relatively prosperous skilled technician who spent 52 years in the steel industry, rising to the board of English Steel.</p><p>Born in Sheffield, Robert was educated at the city's King Edward VII school and, via evening classes, at Sheffield University. His apprenticeship in steel began as an engineering trainee with English Steel. The second world war intervened, and in 1943 he joined the army, serving most of the time in India, where he rose to the rank of captain.</p><p>Demobbed in 1947, he took his first postwar job with the Rotherham steel firm, Steel, Peech and Tozer. Ten years later he was appointed works manager of the company's railway materials division and then its strip mills. From there he moved to Samuel Fox at Stocksbridge near Sheffield, where he was eventually a director and general works manager. In 1967 the firm was absorbed into the nationalised British Steel Corporation.</p><p>Scholey was appointed CBE in 1982 and knighted in 1987. He is survived by Joan, their two daughters, Frances and Rachel, two grandchildren, and a great grandson.</p><p>• Robert Scholey, industrialist, born 8 October 1921;<em> </em>died 12 January 2014</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/06/geoffrey-goodman\" title=\"Guardian: Geoffrey Goodman obituary\">Geoffrey Goodman</a> died last year</p>","headline":"Sir Robert Scholey","trailText":"Chairman of British Steel who made ruthless cuts in preparation for privatisation in 1988","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m5tm","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390563456246/Robert-Scholey-former-Bri-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390563456246/Robert-Scholey-former-Bri-004.jpg","wordcount":"802","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427846345","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8596207","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Geoffrey Goodman","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031502","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-06T23:00:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/sir-robert-scholey","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/24/sir-robert-scholey","tags":[{"id":"business/manufacturing-sector","webTitle":"Manufacturing sector","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing-sector","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/manufacturing-sector","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"politics/privatisation","webTitle":"Privatisation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/privatisation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/privatisation","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/geoffrey-goodman","webTitle":"Geoffrey Goodman","r2ContributorId":"31595","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Geoffrey Goodman is a former industrial editor of the Daily Mirror</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/geoffrey-goodman","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/geoffrey-goodman","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427928904","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/23/1390489706050/Robert-Scholey-former-cha-004.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA Archive","altText":"Robert Scholey, former chairman of British Steel","height":"720","credit":"PA Archive","caption":"Robert Scholey was bloody-minded and made enemies easily, but he had an unparalleled knowledge of the steel industry.

He said:</p><p><blockquote>We were not overly-concerned by Labour Party proposals for fresh intervention to cap market shares and/or trigger further branch divestitures. The potential timing is distant and any financial impact may not prove overtly negative.<br /><br />However, likely nearer-term pressures continue to constrain our view on valuation. We highlight (1) still frothy sellside forecasts for 2013, (2) payment protection insurance top-up risk, (3) enhanced capital notes unwind, (4) other income decline, and (5) possible February government selldown as grounds for caution. <br /></blockquote></p><p>On the capital notes and the decline in other income, Gordon said:</p><p><blockquote>The existence of a £2.2bn \"negative unwind\" from Lloyds' 2009 enhanced capital notes  is hardly new news, though our perception is that there is a general tendency among investors to ignore it!<br /><br />The fair value of the embedded equity conversion feature of the ECNs was written down from £2.2bn to £1.3bn at 30 June 2013. Our expectation (and modelling assumption) is that the remaining £1.3bn will unwind (as a charge to the income statement) in subsequent periods.<br /><br />The decline in other income we forecast from £8.2bn in 2013 to £7.1bn in 2014 primarily reflects a combination of (1) non-recurring St James's Place disposal gains and (2) the elimination of contribution from disposals – primarily St James's Place and (from March 2014), Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. There is also an impact from various 2013 non-core disposals (including Australia, Spain and Germany) as well as the anticipated Project Verde divestment in mid- 2014.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>He also expected the UK government to sell its remaining shares in the bank this year:</p><p><blockquote>After disposing of an initial tranche of 4.3bn shares at 75p on 17 September 2013, the government still owns 23.3bn Lloyds shares, 32.7% of the ordinary equity, with a current market value of around £19.5bn.<br /><br />Speculation will continue as to the precise timing and mechanism for disposal of this stake, but given an apparent overarching political desire to see a disposal ahead of the next UK General Election, due 7 May 2015, our working assumption is that full disposal is likely to be accomplished during 2014.<br /><br />Given that a disposal around current levels would enable the chancellor to declare a profit on the government's \"investment\" without fear of fresh contradiction from the National Audit Office, we see no obvious political impediment to proceeding with such a course of action. As such, we believe that an element of negative technical pressure may act as an additional impediment to any further material share price progression in 2014.<br /><br /></blockquote></p>","headline":"Lloyds Banking Group loses nearly 2% on outlook fears","trailText":"Investec cuts from buy to hold on risks to forecasts and possible government stake sale","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6bm","wordcount":"454","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427929664","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601442","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nick Fletcher","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032042","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-31T11:48:18Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/jan/24/lloyds-banking-down-outlook-governement-stake","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/jan/24/lloyds-banking-down-outlook-governement-stake","tags":[{"id":"business/marketforceslive","webTitle":"Market Forces blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nickfletcher","webTitle":"Nick Fletcher","rcsId":"GNL023406","r2ContributorId":"16178","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/nick_fletcher_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nick Fletcher is a Guardian columnist and writer of the Market Forces column</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nickfletcher","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nickfletcher","references":[]},{"id":"business/lloyds-banking-group","webTitle":"Lloyds Banking Group","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/lloyds-banking-group","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[]},{"webTitle":"Argentinian peso: a sting in the tail or the start of a new crisis? | Larry Elliott","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-24T11:12:44Z","sectionName":"Business","sectionId":"business","id":"business/economics-blog/2014/jan/24/argentina-peso-new-crisis-emerging-market-currencies","fields":{"standfirst":"Investors dump emerging market currencies after steepest fall in Argentinian peso since 2002","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T11:30:46Z","body":"<p>Rarely have new year predictions been proved right so quickly.

Osborne said businesses had been sitting on their cash while the euro was going through \"a near-death experience\" but predicted that investment spending was now about to start to rising.</p><p>The chancellor responded to Summers's charge that Britain, unlike the US, had failed to raise national output above its pre-recession levels by saying that the UK had suffered a deeper slump and was more dependent on the financial sector for its growth.</p><p>\"We did have a much bigger fall in GDP [than in the US], and the impact of the crisis was even harder because our banking sector was a larger share of the economy than in America.</p><p>\"The great recession in the UK had an even greater effect – and we were one of the worse effected of any of the western economies.\"</p><p>But Summers, the man once a front-runner to succeed Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve responded to Osborne's claim that the Bank of England had tools to rein in the property market by pointedly rubbishing the initiative.</p><p>\"I worry about macro-prudential complacency\", Summers said, a reference to the notion that central banks can head off problems before they arise by actions to restrain the animal spirits of lenders.</p><p>Noting that policymakers had failed to spot the stock market crash of 1987 and the sub-prime mortgage crisis, Summers said he was unclear about how macro-prudential policies would work and said tougher measures were needed to make markets safe from \"ignorance and error\".</p><p>Osborne said he agreed with the need for more infrastructure spending, but added there was no \"free lunch\". Governments needed to take tough decisions elsewhere in your budgets, in areas such as welfare spending.</p><p>\"Without a credible fiscal policy, as many other countries learned in this crisis, you don't have a credible monetary policy and your market rates go up.</p><p>\"So while infrastructure spending is needed, you need to make hard choices as finance minister as how to pay for it.\"</p><p>Summers rejected Osborne's argument that high borrowing costs in troubled eurozone countries were the result of governments over-spending and losing the trust of financial markets.</p><p>He said high borrowing costs were due to the specific nature of the eurozone currency – the fixed exchange rate and the inability of individual countries to tailor their economic policies to their own needs.</p>","headline":"Davos 2014: Larry Summers attacks George Osborne's austerity programme","trailText":"Former US Treasury secretary tells World Economic Forum that

But the licensing also comes at a time when the current high level of investment is set to drop dramatically unless new fields are found.</p><p>\"There continues to be extremely high levels of interest in North Sea oil and gas, which is unsurprising when there could be as many as 20 billion barrels of oil still buried deep within the seabed,\" said the energy minister, Michael Fallon. \"This new round of drilling for offshore oil and gas will help boost growth, energy security, and jobs in the UK.\"</p><p>Government statistics suggest the UK oil and gas sector supports around 350,000 jobs, and last year attracted a record £14bn of capital expenditure as well as supplying around half of the UK's primary energy demand.</p><p>The previous round saw a record number of licences awarded, including to 21 new entrants. There are now more than 50 companies working in the North Sea, the government said.</p><p>Last year 36 offshore projects, with an associated capital expenditure of more than £9bn, were approved.

minister says take-home pay rising but more time needed for economy to recover as he pushes to repatriate offshore jobs","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T08:33:53Z","body":"<p>David Cameron has appealed for patience from workers not feeling the benefits of the economic recovery as he launches a drive to repatriate offshore jobs.</p><p>In a fresh effort to blunt Labour's attack over stagnant living standards, the prime minister insisted there were positive signs that take-home pay was starting to rise. But he warned that the scale of the banking crisis and recession meant more time was needed.</p><p>Cameron made the comments ahead of his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, in which he is due to say cheap shale gas energy and a pro-business regulatory climate could encourage firms to move jobs back to the UK.</p><p>According to government figures, about 1,500 manufacturing jobs have returned to Britain since 2011. A new service called Reshore UK is being unveiled to help companies that want to follow suit.</p><p>Cameron will acknowledge that businesses will keep moving production facilities to countries such as India and China in the years to come. But he will cite research that found one in 10 small- and medium-sized businesses had brought production back to the UK over the last year – twice as many as had moved it abroad.</p><p>\"For years the west has been written off,\" Cameron will say. \"People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more.</p><p>\"Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision – the east wins while the west loses; and the workers lose while the machines win.</p><p>\"I don't believe it has to be this way.</p><p>\"Of course, we cannot be starry eyed about globalisation – it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt. But neither should we take this pessimistic view.</p><p>\"Indeed if we make the right decisions, we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from east to west.\"</p><p>Along with narrowing wage differentials between east and west, Cameron will stress the importance of \"pull factors\" such as shorter supply chains, and being based nearer to consumer markets.</p><p>And he will indicate that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy.</p><p>\"There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade,\" he will say.</p><p>\"Taken together, I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the 're-shore nation'.\"</p><p>In broadcast interviews on Thursday night, Cameron gave an optimistic assessment of the prospects for British business.</p><p>An analysis of take-home pay figures circulated by the Treasury has suggested all but the top 10% of earners saw a rise last year. Overall people saw their take-home pay rise by a third more than the rate of CPI inflation, currently 2%.</p><p>Cameron told the BBC: \"We are seeing some positive signs in terms of take-home pay. But it's going to take time. We need to be patient and work through our economic plan so it's a recovery that lasts and benefits everyone.\"</p><p>Cameron urged people to bear in mind that Britain was \"recovering from the longest and deepest recession in living memory\".</p><p>\"I think [the recovery] will be sustainable if we deal with the problems that we had before the recovery came, if we deal with excessive deficits, if we mend the broken banking system, if we make sure that in the case of Britain we rebalance our economy and make sure it's a recovery for all, north and south, to make sure that the poorest people benefit from a recovery,\" he added.</p><p>The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, Paul Johnson, said the government's figures did not take account of benefit reductions and so did not reflect what had happened to household incomes overall.</p><p>Johnson said it appeared that pay was now rising faster than inflation for most workers, but predicted that – after inflation was taken into account – incomes would remain \"well below\" their pre-recession levels by the time of the 2015 general election.</p><p>\"The government's used a perfectly sensible set of numbers, which are its definition of take-home pay, and the survey that it's looking at clearly showed that from April 2012 to April 2013 gross pay for most people went up faster than CPI inflation,\" Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p>But, he added: \"There are two problems with this, which one needs to take into account. First, we have other sets of data – the Office for National Statistics publishes an average weekly earnings index. That went up quite a lot less quickly than inflation in the most recent months. And of course they are not taking account of reductions in things like benefits which were occurring over the time. So if you are looking at household incomes, that will be different from what's happened to take-home pay.\"</p><p>Asked whether the coalition would be able to claim at the time of the election that households were better off, Johnson said: \"We will be able to say definitively – I'm pretty sure – that, come 2015, average household incomes will be lower than they were pre-recession and lower than they were in 2010. Incomes have fallen so much now that there is very little chance that they will have recovered by 2015.</p><p>\"My guess, on the basis of all the different bits of information that we've got at the moment, is that for most people in work, their incomes have stopped falling relative to inflation and if the recovery takes off and continues as expected, people will start to be seeing their incomes rising by the time we get to 2015, but will still be well below where they were six or seven years ago.\"</p>","headline":"David Cameron calls for workers to be patient over pay","trailText":"Prime

He was speaking a day after it emerged that the unemployment rate fell to 7.1%.</p><p>Interviewed on BBC's Newsnight, Carney rejected the idea that plunging unemployment was a headache for the Bank. \"If our forecast is going to be wrong it's better to be wrong in that direction,\" he said.</p><p>Carney also said that when the Bank decided to raise interest rates for the first time since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, the moves would be gradual.</p><p>Economists have warned that a rise to around 3% in the interest rate would lead to huge increases in mortgage costs and a wave of repossessions, as well as damage business.</p><p>Downing Street and the Treasury have been looking nervously at the politically unpredictable consequences of repeated small interest rate rises before the general election in May 2015.</p><p>Although the Treasury maintains that an interest rate rise would help savers and be a sign of an economy returning to normality, No 10 is more ambivalent.</p><p>Downing Street feels assured that Carney is a practical Bank governor driven by the state of the real economy, unlike his more academic predecessor Mervyn King.</p><p>The governor said the Bank's monetary policy committee would be looking at all aspects of the labour market and not just the unemployment rate. The MPC had used the 7% figure to enshrine the idea that joblessness would have to fall considerably before he would \"even begin to think about\" raising borrowing costs.</p><p>Some City analysts are expecting Carney to announce in the next few months that he will lower the threshold at which the Bank would consider raising interest rates to an unemployment level of 6.5%.</p><p>The governor said that would be decided by the MPC but added that it was \"really about overall conditions in the whole labour market\", where productivity remains poor and many people working part-time still want full-time jobs.</p><p>Carney said the economy was \"coming off a low base\" and output was still below the levels when the economy dropped into its deepest recession since the second world war.</p><p>\"The worst of the crisis is behind us but the financial system is not functioning as well as it could,\" he said. \"Uncertainty among households and businesses is still preventing investment.\"</p><p>No 10 remains convinced that a year of growth, so long as it does not tip into over-heating, will ensure Labour's stubborn opinion poll lead is worn down into 2015.</p><p>Although David Cameron  urged voters to be patient on living standards, his aides believe average incomes, once tax changes are taken into account, are already starting to rise above prices.</p><p>In a speech to business people in Davos, Switzerland,  the prime minister will try to present his most optimistic long-term vision of the UK economy for many years , saying Britain can become \"the re-shore nation\" with businesses bringing production back to the UK, encouraged by cheaper energy costs and the lure of shorter customer chains.</p><p>Cameron will hold out the example of  the United States where collapsing energy costs owing to fracking have led businesses to relocate back to the US.</p><p>He will say: \"There is no doubt that when it comes to reshoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade.</p><p>\"I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the Reshore Nation.\"</p><p>Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"The Tory-led government came to office promising an export-led recovery but the UK's trade deficit is growing. Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back.</p><p>\"But after so many government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice.\"</p><p>Cameron's hopes for a boom built on fracking are not shared by the energy department, which is much more ambivalent about the ability of Britain – for geological, political and environmental reasons – to match the US fracking boom, at least not for more than a decade.</p><p>The prime minister will try to rebut internal critics tired of the Tory party's negativity by striking a more optimistic note. He will say: \"For years the west has been written off. People say we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more.</p><p>\"Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision – the east wins while the west loses, and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way. If we make the right decisions, we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from east to west.\"</p><p>To back the rhetoric, UK Trade &amp; Investment will join forces with the Manufacturing Advisory Service to launch Reshore UK, a service to help companies bring production back to Britain.</p>","headline":"Bank

The aid charity Oxfam pointed out that a glance through the richest 100 people in the world shows that the pendulum has already swung heavily in favour of an elite group: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/20/oxfam-85-richest-people-half-of-the-world\" title=\"\">the top 85 in the Forbes rich list control as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population put together</a>.</p><p>A look down the list of 85 shows that if this group – whose wealth tops £1tn – can squeeze on a double decker bus, then Mexico's telecoms magnate <strong>Carlos Slim</strong> swaps driving responsibilities with <strong>Microsoft's Bill Gates</strong> and the tiny group of wealthy women need only seven seats, mostly on the bottom deck.</p><p><strong>Liliane Bettencourt </strong>qualifies as the world's richest woman (and ninth richest indiviual) after a dramatic rise in the value of her 30% holding in cosmetics group L'Oreal, which her father founded. Famous for her family feuds, the 90-year old is the world's ninth richest person with a fortune worth $30bn (£18bn), though she suffers from dementia and no longer sits on the board.</p><p><strong>Christy Walton</strong> is the richest of the Walton clan and 11th richest in the world. She inherited $28.2bn when husband John died in an airplane crash in 2005. Her lead over other Waltons follows a side investment by John in solar panel maker First Solar. Like her sister-in-law Alice, she received nearly $350m in Wal-Mart dividends after taxes in 2013.</p><p>Success in the confectionary business pushed <strong>Jacqueline Mars</strong> to joint number 36 with her brother John and Forrest. They inherited the maker of Mars and Snickers bars in 1999 when their father died.</p><p>Australian <strong>Georgina Rinehart</strong>, like the Mars siblings, is worth $17bn. Charity is not her middle name. In her self-published book she recommended all Aussie workers accept the $2-a-day wages commonly paid in Africa.</p><p><strong>Susanne Klatten</strong> inherited a 12.6% stake in car maker BMW. Along with her brother <strong>Stefan Quandt</strong> (81st richest in the world) and mother <strong>Johanna Quandt</strong> she owns almost 50% of the company. A trained economist, Klatten is Germany's richest woman with assets worth $14.3bn (and 58th richest in the world).</p><p>Germans do well in the rankings of the world's richest. Contrary to the stereotype of a collectivist social democracy from the boardroom to the shop floor, company owners are much better than their UK counterparts at amassing huge fortunes.</p><p><strong>Karl Albrecht</strong> (number 18) owns all of Aldi Sud, Germany's largest discount supermarket chain. With stores across Europe and the US, he outstrips his brother Theo, who inherited the other half of the business. Aldo Sud is worth $26bn while Aldi Nord is worth almost $19bn.</p><p><strong>Dieter Schwarz </strong>(number 29)<strong> </strong>inherited Lidl, the discount retailer that had $85bn in revenues in 2012 and is the second biggest discounter behind Aldi. Dividends are donated to a chiritable company that Schwarz controls. The Schwarz Foundation supports education and daycare facilities for children, according to Forbes.</p><p><strong>Michael Otto</strong> and his four siblings (61st in the world) are another German success story. They share ownership of Otto Group, a conglomerate they inherited that includes a US home furnishings retailer and German toy chain myToys.</p><p>Otto claims the group is the second largest internet retailer after Amazon.</p><p>The last woman on the list is <strong>Abigail Johnson,</strong> who is a third-generation executive at Fidelity Investments, the second-largest US investment fund manager. Her estimated 24% stake gives her an asset worth $12.7bn and a place at number 74.</p>","headline":"The 85 richest people in the world: men still in the driving seat","trailText":"<p>Women need only seven seats, mostly on the bottom deck, on the £1tn double-decker bus revealed by Oxfam this week</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m62b","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390508643886/A-London-bus-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390508643886/A-London-bus-006.jpg","wordcount":"574","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427882137","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8599158","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Phillip Inman Economics correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031788","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/85-richest-people-in-the-world-men-women","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/24/85-richest-people-in-the-world-men-women","tags":[{"id":"business/davos-2014","webTitle":"Davos 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos-2014","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/rich-lists","webTitle":"Rich lists","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/rich-lists","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/rich-lists","references":[]},{"id":"technology/billgates","webTitle":"Bill Gates","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/billgates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/technology/billgates","references":[]},{"id":"business/carlos-slim","webTitle":"Carlos Slim","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/carlos-slim","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/carlos-slim","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/phillipinman","webTitle":"Phillip Inman","rcsId":"GNL359331","r2ContributorId":"16288","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/phillip_inman_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Phillip Inman is economics correspondent of the Guardian and Observer.

In the second test, one sample of Chinese peaches contained 0.11mg/kg. In both tests Australian tinned peaches contained 0.018 mg/kg. Another six types of Chinese peaches were also below the limit for lead content.</p><p>Stone said imported tinned fruit was regularly used by major institutions. “They are under budgetary pressures. They go for the cheapest available. It is definitely in the mix of what they use,” she said.</p><p>“I am deeply concerned fruit with dangerous lead levels could be served in hospitals, aged care homes or prisons and also concerned that if we lose our last fruit processor Australian customers may also no longer have a choice to buy Australian tinned fruit.”</p><p>SPC is the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/29/spc-ardmona-and-fruit-growers-share-uncertain-future\"> last major fruit processing operation</a> in Australia. It has taken fruit from more than 100 fruit growers around the Victorian city of Shepparton, in Stone’s electorate, although this number has been reduced in recent years.</p><p>After cabinet first considered the proposed grant last year, the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, appointed a panel to report back on the company’s long-term sustainability.</p><p>It comprised the Telstra chair, Catherine Livingstone, a former Reserve Bank board member, Dick Warburton, and the former Labor government industry minister Greg Combet. Its report to Macfarlane has not been made public.</p><p>Stone said some state governments had been informed of the test results.</p><p>Labor’s funding pledge was made on condition that SPC Ardmona and Coca-Cola Amatil agreed to maintain operations until 2020 and that the money could not be used to provide for redundancies, executive bonuses, payment of dividends or paying down existing debt.

country’s largest fixed line operator to provide network services in south-east Asia.</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Telstra’s head of global enterprise and services, Brendon Riley, said the proposed joint venture with Telkom Indonesia would accelerate Telstra’s growth in Indonesia, south-east Asia’s largest economy, and more broadly across the region.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Under the terms of the agreement, the joint venture will be the exclusive provider of telecom services to business customers in Indonesia, </span><span style=\"line-height:

customers.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Riley said the proposed joint venture for its so-called network applications and services (NAS) business – which provides businesses with managed network and cloud-based communications services – will build on the strengths of both companies to serve the Indonesian enterprise market.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“Our plan is to provide enhanced consistency of services for companies connecting with Indonesia and operating in the region,” Riley said.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“We are looking forward to partnering with Telkom Indonesia, a well respected market leader, which has a large enterprise and government customer base and the broadest reach of domestic connectivity in Indonesia.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“Indonesia is a fast growing NAS market and we believe the best way to make inroads is by partnering with a well recognised and respected local player. It also aligns to our strategy of supporting our enterprise customers around the globe.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“The proposed joint venture will form part of Telstra’s expansion plans for Asia, where we expect to have both Telstra entities and local market partnerships.”</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“We are looking forward to giving our enterprise customers local support, allowing them to focus on their business rather than managing information technology and telecommunications as a business cost,” Riley said.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Telkom Indonesia group chief strategy and innovation officer Pak Indra Utoyo said: \"We are bringing the proven ICT NAS solutions to Indonesia to assist businesses to be more productive and competitive to support them locally and into the region.\"</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">The deal is part of Telstra’s strategy to build its business services division and shed non-core assets. Earlier this week, it expanded its cloud computing business by buying O2 Networks, a leading Australian provider of business network and security consulting and integration services, for $60m. Late last year it bought Sydney-based cloud business NSC for $100m.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Earlier this month, </span><a

Company, which housewife turned entrepreneur Julie Deane started from her kitchen table, has received a $21m investment that will carry the brand overseas and into new products.</p><p>Known for its fluorescent bags, toted by celebrities on and off screen, the firm has secured the backing of Index Ventures, which has previously invested in retail success stories ASOS and Net-à-Porter.</p><p>Co-founded in 2008 by Deane and her mother Freda Thomas with a budget of £600, the company's fortunes were transformed after a red satchel featured in the Guardian's Christmas gift guide, triggering an avalanche of orders. It now makes 500 bags a day and last year made pre-tax profits of £5m on sales of £13m.</p><p>The handmade bags, a quirky take on the traditional school satchel, have been adopted by members of the fashion pack such as Alexa Chung and buoyed by collaborations with Vivienne Westwood and appearances on hit US TV shows such as Girls and the Good Wife. They are sold in 100 countries.</p><p>Deane spotted a gap in the market for the distinctive style which at the time was not being produced in the UK. \"Satchels are lovely things that didn't deserve to have been forgotten,\" said Deane of the bags – which have a price tag of more than £100.</p><p>Deane, who still oversees almost every aspect of the business, said selling a minority stake would enable it to expand its US business as well as push into new markets such as China. It will develop its product range to include handbags and clutch bags.</p><p>A series of board appointments are planned as it looks to formalise how it operates. \"Up until now it has just been me and mum doing it over a cup of tea,\" Deane said of the deal, which turns her into a paper multimillionaire. \"But the company had got to a size where we needed some help and expertise to reach the next level. Index know how to grow a brand and keep its personality at the same time.\"</p><p>The investment will help preserve British craft skills, Deane said, with plans to double the 50-strong workforce at its Leicestershire factory. Its first factory opened in Wigston in 2011 but last year the company moved to larger premises nearby with the ambition to double bag production within next six months.</p><p></p><p>Index partner Giuseppe Zocco said the brand was \"one of Europe's most exciting entrepreneurial stories\" and praised Deane for \"fearlessly taking on the world\".</p><p>\"We have no doubt that she has the ambition to continue to develop The Cambridge Satchel Company as a world-renowned brand.\"</p>","headline":"Satchel firm bags $21m investment for expansion","trailText":"Cambridge Satchel Company, started with £600 budget, now makes 500 bags a day and has featured in TV shows","newspaperPageNumber":"27","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m639","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2014/1/23/1390512004420/The-Cambridge-Satchel-Com-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2014/1/23/1390512004420/The-Cambridge-Satchel-Com-004.jpg","wordcount":"426","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427886348","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8597632","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Zoe Wood","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031813","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T00:05:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/satchel-firm-21m-investment-expansion","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/24/satchel-firm-21m-investment-expansion","tags":[{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/fashion/fashion","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/zoewood","webTitle":"Zoe Wood","r2ContributorId":"20559","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/12/27/1356607956793/Zoe-Wood-byline-pic---Dec-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Zoe Wood writes about retail and consumer goods companies for the Observer and the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoewood","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/zoewood","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/financial3","webTitle":"Financial","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427887211","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/cartoon/2014/1/23/1390511996160/The-Cambridge-Satchel-Com-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PR company handout","photographer":"Jason Baker","altText":"The Cambridge Satchel Company","height":"54","credit":"Jason Baker/PR company handout","caption":"The Cambridge Satchel Company was started with a budget of just £600.

After the Great Moderation and the Great Recession, there are several reasons why it will be years before any superlatives are attached to this recovery.\"</p><p>Carney said overall debt burdens of advanced countries had increased since the crisis, the global economy remained unbalanced and confidence remained fragile.</p><p>But he said policymakers had avoided the mistakes made during the 1930s and there was a chance that a new wave of innovations would lead to a new era of growth, following the pattern of the post second world war boom.</p><p>\"Protectionism is being resisted, banks recapitalised, and the global financial system rebuilt. In parallel, monetary policy is highly accommodative,\" he said.</p><p>\"As the global economy gains momentum, staying the course on these policies will be decisive to achieving escape velocity. The United Kingdom is at the centre of these decisions.\"</p><p>Carney admitted that unemployment had fallen faster than predicted since August when the Bank set a 7% jobless rate as the threshold for considering higher interest rates.</p><p>\"The latest data show that more than a quarter of a million jobs were created in a three-month period – the biggest increase since records began in 1971. As a result, unemployment seems to be falling at a pace that will reach our 7% threshold materially earlier than we had expected.\"</p><p>Many City economists expect unemployment to hit 7% within the next couple of months, but Carney said this would not lead to rates being raised from 0.5%, where they have been since early 2009.</p><p>\"Crucially, unemployment remains above the level that is likely to be consistent with maintaining inflation at the target in the medium term. It is not just that nearly three quarters of a million more people are out of work than before the crisis; another three quarters of a million more people are involuntarily working part time.\"</p><p>Giving a clear signal that he favoured amending forward guidance to take account of the improving labour market, the governor said: \"It now seems likely that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation in the medium term is somewhat lower than the MPC assessed back in August.</p><p>\"In part that is because rates of transition into jobs, even for those who have been unemployed for more than a year, have been sustained at high rates, minimising the extent of skill atrophy. In addition, other measures of slack in the labour market, such as involuntary part-time working remain high.</p><p>\"This suggests that, even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of monetary policy. It is widely recognised that our 7% threshold is not a trigger for raising Bank Rate.\"</p><p>Carney said that when the Bank announced forward guidance it made clear that the 7% unemployment threshold was not an interest-rate trigger.</p><p>\"The MPC will consider a range of options to update our guidance, recognising both what we have learned about the behaviour of aggregate supply in the economy as well as the more benign inflation outlook.\"</p>","headline":"UK economy well short of escape velocity, Mark Carney tells Davos","trailText":"Bank of England governor pledges that 'path of interest rates will be consistent with sustained recovery'","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6bt","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564135189/Mark-Carney-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564135189/Mark-Carney-006.jpg","wordcount":"757","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427929462","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601208","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Larry Elliott and Jill Treanor","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032038","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T12:26:18Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/24/uk-economy-escape-velocity-mark-carney-interest-rates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/24/uk-economy-escape-velocity-mark-carney-interest-rates","tags":[{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/interest-rates","webTitle":"Interest rates","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/interest-rates","references":[]},{"id":"business/bankofenglandgovernor","webTitle":"Bank of England","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos-2014","webTitle":"Davos 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos-2014","references":[]},{"id":"business/davos","webTitle":"Davos","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/davos","references":[]},{"id":"profile/larryelliott","webTitle":"Larry Elliott","rcsId":"GNL001696","r2ContributorId":"15965","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/larry_elliott_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Larry Elliott is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics\">economics</a> editor and has been with the paper since 1988</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/larryelliott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/larryelliott","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jilltreanor","webTitle":"Jill Treanor","rcsId":"GNL003510","r2ContributorId":"15822","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jill_treanor_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jill Treanor is the Guardian's City editor.

By Thursday's close, it was at 8 to the dollar. On the black market, where Argentina's currency is even weaker, the peso dropped 6 percent Thursday to 13 per dollar.</p><p>The sharp depreciation is likely due to a new government strategy of seeking a sudden devaluation instead of a gradual one, said Juan Pablo Ronderos of economic consulting firm abeceb.com.</p><p>\"There was a first sign of this change on Tuesday because the central bank didn't show up (to intervene) until midday, and on Wednesday and today it just disappeared from the market,\" Ronderos said. \"The gradual devaluation wasn't working because the central bank kept on sacrificing lots of its reserves and it kept on being reflected on consumer prices.\"</p><p>Analysts expect Argentina's inflation to reach more than 30 percent this year, the second highest rate in Latin America after Venezuela.</p><p>\"The sharp drop will aggravate inflation, although the impact may be mitigated by the fact that some imports will already be purchased at the much weaker black market exchange rate,\" Neil Shearing, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics in London, said in a research note.</p><p>\"The bigger picture, though, is that the economic mismanagement of the past decade has once again pushed the country to the brink of a balance of payments crisis,\" Shearing wrote.</p><p>Critics of the left-leaning government of President Cristina Kirchner blame economic problems on its higher spending on social programs, expansion of business regulation and nationalisation of some companies.</p><p>Argentina has been kept from global credit markets since defaulting on its debt during its 2001-2002 financial crisis. So officials have been trying to keep dollars in the country for the central bank to use to pay off government debts.</p><p>But the bank's reserves have plunged to $29 billion, the lowest level in more than seven years despite increasingly restrictive currency controls meant to stem capital flight.</p><p>The controls make it nearly impossible to legally trade pesos for dollars, but many Argentines have turned to black market money changers to obtain dollars.</p><p>Many in the country are haunted by memories of the financial crisis, when banks froze deposits and the currency lost value, and they want dollars to keep in emergency stashes.</p>","headline":"Argentinian peso in freefall as economic crisis deepens","trailText":"Currency falls at fastest rate since 2002 collapse as central bank runs out of reserves to enter market<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m657","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527110343/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527110343/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427898589","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e1be76e4b065f7ddbb840b","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Reuters in Buenos Aires","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031865","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T01:34:52Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/argentinian-peso-freefall-economic-crisis-deepens","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/24/argentinian-peso-freefall-economic-crisis-deepens","tags":[{"id":"world/argentina","webTitle":"Argentina","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/argentina","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/currencies","references":[]},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/americas","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-b3b9f58f-adb9-4930-8bc6-e63dc2fc848a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527109834/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390527109834/ba92804c-2bd8-48f8-994d-c527bcaa90ad-220x132.jpeg","source":"AP","photographer":"Victor R.

But he warned that the scale of the banking crisis and recession meant more time was needed.</p><p>Cameron made the comments ahead of his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, in which he is due to say cheap shale gas energy and a pro-business regulatory climate could encourage firms to move jobs back to the UK.</p><p>According to government figures, about 1,500 manufacturing jobs have returned to Britain since 2011. A new service called Reshore UK is being unveiled to help companies that want to follow suit.</p><p>Cameron will acknowledge that businesses will keep moving production facilities to countries such as India and China in the years to come. But he will cite research that found one in 10 small- and medium-sized businesses had brought production back to the UK over the last year – twice as many as had moved it abroad.</p><p>\"For years the west has been written off,\" Cameron will say. \"People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more.</p><p>\"Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision – the east wins while the west loses; and the workers lose while the machines win.</p><p>\"I don't believe it has to be this way.</p><p>\"Of course, we cannot be starry eyed about globalisation – it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt. But neither should we take this pessimistic view.</p><p>\"Indeed if we make the right decisions, we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from east to west.\"</p><p>Along with narrowing wage differentials between east and west, Cameron will stress the importance of \"pull factors\" such as shorter supply chains, and being based nearer to consumer markets.</p><p>And he will indicate that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy.</p><p>\"There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade,\" he will say.</p><p>\"Taken together, I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the 're-shore nation'.\"</p><p>In broadcast interviews on Thursday night, Cameron gave an optimistic assessment of the prospects for British business.</p><p>An analysis of take-home pay figures circulated by the Treasury has suggested all but the top 10% of earners saw a rise last year. Overall people saw their take-home pay rise by a third more than the rate of CPI inflation, currently 2%.</p><p>Cameron told the BBC: \"We are seeing some positive signs in terms of take-home pay. But it's going to take time. We need to be patient and work through our economic plan so it's a recovery that lasts and benefits everyone.\"</p><p>Cameron urged people to bear in mind that Britain was \"recovering from the longest and deepest recession in living memory\".</p><p>\"I think [the recovery] will be sustainable if we deal with the problems that we had before the recovery came, if we deal with excessive deficits, if we mend the broken banking system, if we make sure that in the case of Britain we rebalance our economy and make sure it's a recovery for all, north and south, to make sure that the poorest people benefit from a recovery,\" he added.</p><p>The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, Paul Johnson, said the government's figures did not take account of benefit reductions and so did not reflect what had happened to household incomes overall.</p><p>Johnson said it appeared that pay was now rising faster than inflation for most workers, but predicted that – after inflation was taken into account – incomes would remain \"well below\" their pre-recession levels by the time of the 2015 general election.</p><p>\"The government's used a perfectly sensible set of numbers, which are its definition of take-home pay, and the survey that it's looking at clearly showed that from April 2012 to April 2013 gross pay for most people went up faster than CPI inflation,\" Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p>But, he added: \"There are two problems with this, which one needs to take into account. First, we have other sets of data – the Office for National Statistics publishes an average weekly earnings index. That went up quite a lot less quickly than inflation in the most recent months. And of course they are not taking account of reductions in things like benefits which were occurring over the time. So if you are looking at household incomes, that will be different from what's happened to take-home pay.\"</p><p>Asked whether the coalition would be able to claim at the time of the election that households were better off, Johnson said: \"We will be able to say definitively – I'm pretty sure – that, come 2015, average household incomes will be lower than they were pre-recession and lower than they were in 2010. Incomes have fallen so much now that there is very little chance that they will have recovered by 2015.</p><p>\"My guess, on the basis of all the different bits of information that we've got at the moment, is that for most people in work, their incomes have stopped falling relative to inflation and if the recovery takes off and continues as expected, people will start to be seeing their incomes rising by the time we get to 2015, but will still be well below where they were six or seven years ago.\"</p>","headline":"David Cameron calls for workers to be patient over pay","trailText":"Prime

Apple is also widely expected to release iPhones with big-screens, a key feature of Samsung's Galaxy range.</p><p>On Friday, Samsung reported its first quarterly operating profit decline in two years partly because Apple's new iPhones drew away sales during the year-end holiday period in the United States and Japan.</p><p>Yet Samsung doubled its 2013 dividend yield to 1%, sticking to a promise made to shareholders in November. Investors point out that is still half of Apple's 2%.</p><p>\"Our goal on dividend payout for this year is to have that significantly increase from 2013, but I can't say for sure how much we'll be paying,\" Robert Yi, head of Samsung's investor relations, told analysts after the earnings release.</p><p>The South Korean manufacturer declared a ₩14,300 (808p) per share dividend for 2013, or a total handout of ₩2.1tn. The amount is 79%t more than a year earlier but is just 6.9% of 2013 profit.</p><p>\"Samsung is clearly under growing pressure to return more to investors,\" said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management.</p><p>\"With its shares trending down, I think Samsung will have to consider extra measures like a share buyback at some point to address shareholder pressure.\"</p><p>Shares of Samsung, worth $204bn, ended up 0.62% compared with the benchmark index which fell 0.36%. The stock has fallen 8.8% in the past month on concern over slowing smartphone growth.</p><p></p><p>Samsung posted a 6% on-year decline in operating profit for October-December to ₩8.3tn, the company said on Friday, matching its previous estimate.</p><p>The figure was brought down by an ₩800bn special employee bonus to commemorate 20 years since Chairman Lee Kun-hee announced a management strategy that the company regards as the catalyst to its recent growth.</p><p>A stronger domestic currency also knocked off around ₩700bn.</p><p>\"It will be challenging for Samsung to improve its earnings in the first quarter as the weak seasonality of the IT industry will put pressure on demand for components and TV products,\" the company said in a statement.</p>","headline":"Samsung doubles dividend

Osborne said businesses had been sitting on their cash while the euro was going through \"a near-death experience\" but predicted that investment spending was now about to start to rising.</p><p>The chancellor responded to Summers's charge that Britain, unlike the US, had failed to raise national output above its pre-recession levels by saying that the UK had suffered a deeper slump and was more dependent on the financial sector for its growth.</p><p>\"We did have a much bigger fall in GDP [than in the US], and the impact of the crisis was even harder because our banking sector was a larger share of the economy than in America.</p><p>\"The great recession in the UK had an even greater effect – and we were one of the worse effected of any of the western economies.\"</p><p>But Summers, the man once a front-runner to succeed Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve responded to Osborne's claim that the Bank of England had tools to rein in the property market by pointedly rubbishing the initiative.</p><p>\"I worry about macro-prudential complacency\", Summers said, a reference to the notion that central banks can head off problems before they arise by actions to restrain the animal spirits of lenders.</p><p>Noting that policymakers had failed to spot the stock market crash of 1987 and the sub-prime mortgage crisis, Summers said he was unclear about how macro-prudential policies would work and said tougher measures were needed to make markets safe from \"ignorance and error\".</p><p>Osborne said he agreed with the need for more infrastructure spending, but added there was no \"free lunch\". Governments needed to take tough decisions elsewhere in your budgets, in areas such as welfare spending.</p><p>\"Without a credible fiscal policy, as many other countries learned in this crisis, you don't have a credible monetary policy and your market rates go up.</p><p>\"So while infrastructure spending is needed, you need to make hard choices as finance minister as how to pay for it.\"</p><p>Summers rejected Osborne's argument that high borrowing costs in troubled eurozone countries were the result of governments over-spending and losing the trust of financial markets.</p><p>He said high borrowing costs were due to the specific nature of the eurozone currency – the fixed exchange rate and the inability of individual countries to tailor their economic policies to their own needs.</p>","headline":"Davos 2014: Larry Summers attacks George Osborne's austerity programme","trailText":"Former US Treasury secretary tells World Economic Forum that

Sixty or so Davos movers and shakers are being urged to gaze at their thoughts by a French Buddhist monk swathed in robes of red and yellow. \"Meditation is about mastering your thoughts, it's about being in charge of your mind. It's real freedom,\" said Matthieu Ricard.</p><p>\"You are not the slave of your thoughts. One way is to just gaze at them … like a shepherd sitting above a meadow watching the sheep,\" added the monk, a man who speaks, lectures and writes about being happy.</p><p>Eyes closed tight, the delegates of the World Economic Forum in Davos have queued devotedly for half an hour for this early morning session.</p><p>The attraction is not just the chance to learn how to meditate from one of the most respected masters of the art, but also to do so in the presence of movie star Goldie Hawn. Davos is not just about power meetings and deals – on Thursday it was also where the secrets of eastern religion met Hollywood: Hawn is in Davos on a mission to explain how she believes children can benefit from meditation.</p><p>Those who have queued long enough to get into the room – 10 round tables, coffee and pastries in the corner – are completely silent as they receive instruction on how to be \"in charge of their minds\". They are learning the art of meditation even as President Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, is pledging in the main hall not to use his nuclear power to create weapons.</p><p>Two bits of advice are being offered to those gazing at their difficult thoughts. Do not try to hide away from the problem and equally do not try to explode it like a time bomb. Much better to let it melt away – \"slowly melting like the frost under the morning sun\".</p><p>Ricard leads three short moments of meditation, each one accompanied by soothing, reassuring words. Each of those present is studiously following the advice. They appear hooked. And would not be alone.</p><p>The delegates are told how Steve Jobs of Apple mixed business with meditation. An article in Fortune magazine recently outlined how traders at Goldman Sachs – more widely known for their animal spirits – have also been coached in how to train their minds. Forget Leonardo DiCaprio and the Wolf of Wall Street: these guys have got their karma together.</p><p>Hawn has been meditating since 1972 and probably needed all the calm she could muster just a few hours after sharing her experiences at WEF, when she posted pictures of herself with Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan then hastily had to take them down again after running into a Twitter storm focused on his anti-gay views.</p><p>Goldie's session is not just all about the practical side of meditation. Charts flash up on the wall – this is Davos after all – showing lines that could be profit and loss charts, but actually represent brain activity.</p><p>An academic – Richard Davidson of the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin – has a chart showing flu vaccines work better on those who have meditated. And he encourages everyone to give it a go and make it as commonplace as physical exercise became after the 1950s. \"The same thing will happen with mental exercise. You can begin with very small periods of exercise. Start with bite-sized chunks … We need a massive worldwide media campaign to teach people the fact that wellbeing can be learned,\" Davidson said.</p><p>• This article was amended on 24 January 2014 to correct several errors in grammar and spelling.</p>","headline":"And breathe ...

on course for £1.5bn profit but calls for taxpayer cost burden","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-23T17:11:00Z","sectionName":"Business","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2014/jan/23/sse-energy-profit-cost-burden-transfer-taxpayer","fields":{"standfirst":"Power supplier expects to increase annual profit by 8.8% while re-issuing call for costs of social policy to shift to taxpayer","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-01-24T11:57:41Z","body":"<p>SSE reignited the simmering row over high energy prices when it said yesterday that it was on course for a substantial increase in profits to more than £1.5bn and re-issued a call for more of its social and environmental burdens to be transferred to the taxpayer.</p><p>The company, fomerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected to announce at its financial year end to 31 March that it has increased profits by 8.8% and will reward shareholders with a higher dividend.<br />SSE also warned that the levels of investment seen in recent years would be reduced and it is reviewing some of its planned windfarm projects after they failed to obtain the government backing expected.</p><p>The power supplier was the first of the big six to raise its bills – by an average of over 8% – in the autumn, blaming green levies, and will be the last to reduce them – by 3.5% on 24 March – after ministers partly lifted the costs associated with the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). </p><p>But Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE which has lost around 250,000 customers over the last nine months, said the government action so far was not enough. </p><p>\"In the interests of fairness … there is still more to be done to achieve what we have argued for some time is the fairest, most progressive solution – which is to shift the full cost burden of environmental and social policies from the energy bill payer to the taxpayer.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Mark Todd, director of independent price comparison website energyhelpline, argued that SSE had clearly delivered for its shareholders but customers had lost out.</p><p>\"The only real winners in the current energy market appear to be the big energy suppliers and their shareholders who are making scorching profits as customers struggle to keep warm through this wet and windy winter.\"</p><p>Caroline Flint MP, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said energy companies think they can get away with treating their customers poorly because they know David Cameron will never stand up to them.<br />\"The next Labour government will undertake the biggest overhaul of our energy market since privatisation. Our plans will break up the big energy companies, put an end to their secret deals and make tariffs simpler and fairer. And until these reforms kick in, we will put a stop to unfair price rises by freezing energy bills until 2017, saving the average household £120.\"</p><p>Ed Miliband accused SSE of \"ripping off\" its seven million customers when it first announced its 8.2% rise in October and many were surprised that the company was slower than others to respond to ministers lifting the ECO burden.</p><p>Perth-based SSE supplies retail power under the Southern Electric, Scottish Hydro and Swalec banners and is also one of the power distribution firms which struggled to maintain its networks after heavy storms. </p><p>About 750,000 properties were affected, and many left without power for days over Christmas by a series of network providers. Earlier this week in a review of the way the problems had been handled, Tim Yeo, the chairman of the House of Commons energy select committee, said there seemed to be a lack of any \"expression of real concern\" by firms for those affected. </p><p>Mark Mathieson, managing director of SSE networks, praised the efforts of staff who turned out to reconnect properties in problems caused by a \"unique\" weather situation.</p><p>But he admitted the industry had to learn lessons. \"We as an industry clean these events up much quicker than we used to. But we also recognise the impact that has on customers,\" he said.</p><p>SSE has ramped up its power output from renewable energy sources over the last year but said it was reviewing future investment after its Galloper and Beatrice offshore wind farms failed to be included in a Department of Energy and Climate Change list of provisionally affordable projects. Overall future investment over the next five years is likely to be lower than the £1.5bn to £1.7bn spent annually since 2010.</p><p>• <a

The factory was opened in 1879 and turns out 1.2m Creme Eggs, 5.5m bars of chocolate, 400m Dairy Milk Buttons and millions of other products a day.</p><p>The firm said it would be the first significant investment in the plant for 30 years and will include replacing production lines as well as building new ones.</p><p>Chicago-based Mondelez said securing the investment depended on the results of consultations with employees to cut costs and change ways of working. The changes, combined with the investment \"will help to close the competitiveness gap between Bournville and its competitors as well as sister factories in Germany and western Europe\", Mondelez said in a statement.</p><p>Consultations will centre on improving competitiveness, working more flexibly and investing in training.</p><p>Neil Chapman, manufacturing director of Chocolate UK for Mondelez, said: \"The competitiveness gap we have identified means we are already missing out on important opportunities to grow. We want to hear as many ideas as possible from our employees on how, alongside our £75m investment, we achieve improvements that boost competitiveness, thereby securing the next generation of manufacturing at Bournville.\"</p><p>Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate bar was first produced at the factory in 1905, with the first cream-filled egg in 1923. Bournville is home to the firm's Global Centre of Excellence for Chocolate research and development site. Every new chocolate product created by Cadbury starts life at the Midlands plant.</p><p>The factory employs about 960 people. Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy said: \"This investment is good news and the union has been working with Cadbury to get the best deal possible for workers during this restructuring. It is yet another example of success when unions and employers work together in the manufacturing industry.\"</p>","headline":"Cadbury owner considering £75m upgrade of Bournville site","trailText":"US firm says securing investment depends on results of staff consultations about cutting costs and changing work practices","newspaperPageNumber":"27","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6vh","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/23/1390501192230/Upgrade-for-Cadbury-Bourn-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/23/1390501192230/Upgrade-for-Cadbury-Bourn-006.jpg","wordcount":"330","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427874533","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8598999","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Press Association","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031740","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T18:21:40Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/23/cadbury-owner-75m-upgrade-bournville","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/23/cadbury-owner-75m-upgrade-bournville","tags":[{"id":"business/cadburyschweppes","webTitle":"Cadbury","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/cadburyschweppes","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/cadburyschweppes","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"uk/birmingham","webTitle":"Birmingham","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/birmingham","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/financial3","webTitle":"Financial","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/financial3","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427875105","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/23/1390501181874/Upgrade-for-Cadbury-Bourn-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"PA","photographer":"Mondelez International","altText":"Upgrade for Cadbury Bournville site","height":"54","credit":"Mondelez International/PA","caption":"Cadbury's Bournville site in Birmingham.
