  // Hi there!
  // If you are reading this, you're probably trying to create a new Content Type.
  // Please note that we send the content types to DFP for ad tracking.
  // However, DFP will only recognise the content types in the PREDEFINED LIST.
  //
  // In DFP, this list is here:
  // Inventory > Customised targeting > ct
  //
  // Please get Ad Ops to add it to the list BEFORE adding a new content type here.
  // cheers,
  // ken lim (8 July 2014)
